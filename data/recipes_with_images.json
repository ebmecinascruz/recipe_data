Gradually add warm water while stirring to moisten the couscous. Let it sit for 10 minutes to absorb the water.",
      "First Steam: Transfer the couscous to a couscoussier (a traditional steamer) or a fine-mesh steamer basket. Steam over simmering water for 20 minutes, fluffing the couscous with a fork every 10 minutes to prevent clumping. If you don’t have a steamer, you can use a colander placed over a pot of boiling water, covered with a lid.",

      "Cool and Rest: Let the couscous cool for 10-15 minutes. This allows the grains to absorb the salted water and prepares them for the second steam.",
      "Brown the Meat: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the meat and brown it on all sides. Remove and set aside.",
      "Cook the Aromatics: In the same pot, add the chopped onions and garlic. Sauté until softened and golden.",
      "Add Spices: Stir in the tomato paste, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric and cinnamon (if using). Cook for 2-3 minutes to release the flavors.",
      "Simmer the Meat: Return the meat to the pot and add the water or broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for about 1 hour or until the meat is tender.",
      "Second Steam for Couscous: After cooling and breaking up the couscous with salted water, return it to the steamer. Steam for another 20 minutes, fluffing with a fork every 10 minutes. This second steam ensures the couscous is light, fluffy and fully cooked.",
      "Add Hard Vegetables: After the meat has simmered for 30 minutes, add the carrots, turnip and potatoes. Continue simmering.",
      "Add Soft Vegetables: After another 15 minutes, add the zucchini, pumpkin and chickpeas. Cook until all the vegetables are tender but not mushy (about 15-20 minutes).",
      "Fluff the Couscous: Once the couscous is steamed for the second time, transfer it to a large serving dish. Drizzle a ladle of broth from the stew over the couscous and fluff it with a fork to separate the grains.",

      "Fill a bowl with salt water to rinse your fingers and season the onigiri. You can fill and shape the onigiri using two different methods:\nMethod 1: Wet your hands in the salt water. Take two large spoonfuls of rice into one hand (carefully; the rice is hot), and gently squeeze and flatten it with the other. Make an indentation in the middle, and put some of the filling into the center. Be a little careful to get the filling only in the center and not all over the ball; that can make the rice less sticky, and stickiness is good. \"Fold\" the rice over the filling so it becomes covered. Squeeze gently, and mold it into a triangular shape by folding both your hands along the palms while keeping the fingers straight. Squeeze like that, rotating the ball a few times, and you will soon have a very neat triangle—this really is much harder to explain than to do. Once the ball is done, put it down on a clean surface to cool down. Rinse your hands in the salt water and repeat.\nMethod 2: Use a bowl and some plastic film. Place about 2/3 of the mixture into the centre of the cling wrap that has been draped into the bowl loosely. Then, add approximately 2 teaspoons of filling (this is working off of about 3–4 portions per cup of rice. Then, place the last 1/3 of the rice to the top. Then, mould the onigiri within the cling wrap. This drastically reduces mess and also is slightly more 'kid friendly'.",

      "Once the balls are reasonably cool, you need to protect them from drying out. The easiest way is to wrap them in cling wrap, or put them into an airtight plastic food container. When it is time to eat, take one rice ball, wrap it in a piece of nori, and eat away. If you don't mind soggy nori, you can wrap the balls in nori beforehand."

      "Heat the beef broth to a boil in the skillet, whisking in the tomato paste and anchovies. Add this to the veal shanks, along with the herbs, several grindings of pepper, and a large pinch of salt. The liquid should cover three quarters of the shanks. If not, add extra water.",
      "Bring the pot to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for approximately 2 hours, turning and basting the shanks every half hour. If you notice that the cooking liquids have nearly evaporated, add hot water, about one half cup at a time. The veal is done when it is fork tender and falling from the bone.",

      "After 10 minutes have passed, you should have a flavorful broth. It's customary at this point to allow your dinner guests to taste it. The purpose is to determine if the broth needs more salt. If so, add more salt, a pinch at a time, until everybody is satisfied.",
      "Add the rice and stir it using the rice skimmer. Then, once again with the skimmer, spread the rice over the bottom of the paellera. The coating of rice should be one centimeter thick. Let it cook over a high flame for 10 minutes.",
      "Reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer for 4 minutes. Add the canned haricot beans, reduce the heat again to low, and let it simmer for another 4 minutes. Taste the rice frequently to determine when it's fully cooked. You'll know it's done when it's slightly firm to the bite. Italians use a similar approach when cooking pasta, which they refer to as al dente.",
      "At this point, there should be some toasted rice sticking to the bottom of the pan. This is a delicacy in Valencia called socarrat. If no socarrat has developed, increase the flame to high and listen for the crackling sound of rice toasting at the bottom.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat when the rice is almost dry, and place the unused rosemary branches on top. Cover with a clean, white towel (a white towel prevents dye from leeching onto the paella) and wait 5 minutes before serving to allow the rice to absorb the remaining broth."
