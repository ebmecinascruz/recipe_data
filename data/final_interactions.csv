5060,30081,2005-03-18,2,"Well I'm really sorry but we found these absolutley without taste! They were very dry hamberger and couln't taste the garlic or onion powder, perhaps we're used to fresh garlic and onions.  We also found the sauce very mild and too sweet. Quite disappointing after reading all the rave reviews, sorry but we would'nt make these again."
39835,30081,2005-08-26,3,"These were good for sandwich night, but I found the hamburgers  a bit dry and hard to slice, but I may have left them in the broiler too long. I also bought the wrong kind of pitas - bought Greek pita bread instead of the other kind, so we just added everything on the pita and rolled them up like burritoes -- good and fillling. I also found the dressing a bit too different for our tastes - maybe next time I'll try it with sour cream instead of yogurt. These were good for a change of pace, but I think we'll go back to traditional hamburgers.  Thanks for sharing!"
158086,30081,2006-08-23,5,This was very easy and tasted wonderful...my better half ate all the patties and declared it a winner in his book.
53932,30081,2006-09-08,4,"I used ground turkey and thought the spices were just right (except the salt, which I think was a bit much so next time will add it after cooking).  "
176615,30081,2008-06-06,5,"Great recipe! Superfast and easy, the whole family enjoyed them. Wrapped some flatbread in foil and heated on the grill while the meat was cooking. Will make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
140132,30081,2010-01-16,5,We all loved these.  I will makethis often this summer.  Its a great way to enjoy burgers tahts different from the ordinary burgers on a bun.  thank you for sharing.
126440,30081,2012-06-30,5,Loved it! Used Recipe #79388 for the pita.
1072593,30081,2015-05-09,5,"I love the challenge of a new recipe...staying busy, plotting and planning.
It makes me forget that I&#039;m growing older.  Speaking of older, where was I...ohhh the gyro...this one&#039;s a real keeper!"
8688,26110,2003-03-06,5,"Excellent recipe for delicious and fabulous results! Buttery flavor, light and flaky, these biscuits will be a hit at your next breakfast, fried chicken or ham supper!  Very simple recipe and easy to follow directions. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!"
5060,26110,2003-03-11,5,"Wonderful wonderful!! butermilk biscuits!!  i think in the past I was handling them too much. What a difference, light flakey and tender, and easy because of your instruction.  Soooo nice of you to give the lesson. Thank-you and I will certainly be making these again!!"
39835,26110,2003-10-31,4,"Good biscuits which we enjoyed  but they didn't rise much, however I did decrease the baking powder to 2 teaspoons (I usually decrease baking powder and soda due to high altitude) and next time I will use the specified amount. However these were super easy using the food processor and we will be making these again. Thanks for sharing!"
95743,26110,2004-10-20,5,"So good, Dh has hidden the leftovers so he can have ALL of them for his breakfast tomorrow. Darn."
176615,26110,2005-05-26,5,"Wonderful biscuits! What really sets this recipe apart are the detailed directions and very easy prep using a food processor. Served with homemade blackberry jam and honey butter, also eggs, bacon and grits for a real treat. Thanks, P4, for a keeper!"
128473,26110,2007-02-05,5,"These are by far the best buttermilk biscuits that I have tried on Zarr so far.  Wow! they are so tender that they melt in your mouth. The biscuits are light and airy,  rose nice and big, were crispy on the outside and tender and soft on the inside. I served the warm biscuits with Bev's Orange Honey Butter. I'm still in heaven, was it breakfast or dessert, I'm not sure, but I'll definitely be using the rest of the biscuits tonight for our strawberry shortcake. P4, thanks so much for sharing your quick and easy to make recipe."
461834,26110,2007-03-19,5,"WOW!!!Thank you P4 for this recipe!!!  Using the food processor made such a difference and, needless to say, cut way back on the time needed to make biscuits.  These tasted fantastic."
173579,26110,2008-01-16,5,Very nice biscuits.  Thanks for posting.
126440,26110,2009-03-30,5,Great biscuits.  I haven't made biscuits in a long time.  I used my food processor and was very easy to make.  Flavor is great and DH keeps eating the rest of them for a snack.  I only got eight but used my Eng. muffin cutter so they were a little bigger.
1072593,26110,2009-04-06,5,You have no idea how many biscuit recipes I've tried resulting from pure disaster to mediocre.  These were moist and buttery yet light in texture.  Technique is half the success of the recipe and I think I've got it with your clear instructions.  Two thumbs up from all family members.
140132,26110,2010-01-06,4,"Wow, these are so good.  I have tried to make biscuits before and they turned out more like hockey pucks instead of something edible.  I was a little leary about trying these but decieded I needed to try.  I am so glad I did.  Your instructions were very clear and precise.  Thank you for posting this recipe, I, for one, and very very happy."
171790,26110,2010-03-13,5,"I made these to go with last night's dinner. They were great, tender and light! Made for Top Favorites of 2009 Cookbook Tag."
428885,26110,2011-03-30,5,"Have to say, I'm with the masses on this one! I followed this exactly, except used lard in place of the butter, and talk about flaky.....you couldn't ask for more then this. These were perfect, the directions very concise, pushing lightly down on the dough instead of using rolling pin, all the advice makes a perfect biscuit. Very light and fluffy~ a must try for any and all!"
1179225,26110,2011-12-10,5,"Perfection! This is one of those recipes you save and use forever. We have no need to try another biscuit recipe. DH made these and followed your recipe on down the line. They came out light, fluffy, tasty and tall! We seved them with sausage gravy for a heavenly Saturday morning breakfat. Thanks so much for sharing this amazing recipe!"
169969,3470,2004-12-22,5,Very easy and Very Tasty! We thought it was really good...and we are not too fond of recipies with canned soup. I did use the low sodium soup as this tends to cut down on the salty taste that the condensed soup adds to dishes. Thank you for an easy meal!!! 
482376,3470,2007-10-04,5,"Delish! It was very easy to put together and the outcome was pure comfort. Nothing fancy, just that good ol' comfort food taste. I used provolone cheese, since I don't care for swiss. It was great. Thanks!"
140132,3470,2007-12-30,5,Very good.  I served this with mashed potatoes and cranberries.  Delicious meal.  I cooked on low for 6 hours and it was done perfectly.  Thanks for a really good chicken dinner....Stephanie
158086,3470,2008-11-04,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe...I have not been feeling so good, and have had not much of an appetite, this was a good thing to make and tasted wonderful...I too did not have any swiss cheese so subbed with morzerella and provolone blend."
173579,3470,2011-03-11,5,We thought this was a very good Chicken and Dressing.  Only thing I would suggest is one might use the lower sodium soups.  It tends to be a little salty tasting.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
39835,37413,2003-10-31,5,"Very good way to have burgers!  We served this with Southern Buttermilk Biscuits recipe#26110 and corn for a great ""comfort"" meal. Thanks for sharing this keeper middle-of-the-week quick supper recipe."
101823,37413,2003-11-05,5,"My husband prepared this tonight!  It was a definate treat to have a home-style meal and not to have to cook it!  He subbed beef broth for the water in the gravy, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was hearty and definately flavored well.  He served it with egg noodles and a salad.  We will be adding this to our easy home cooking file!"
157425,37413,2005-03-13,3,"The gravy was a bit salty for our taste. Added a can of beef gravy and that helped. I used ground round and the patties were a bit bland. Not a great recipe for us, sorry."
169969,37413,2005-04-08,5,"This was so easy to make and DH gobbled it up. We are a bit salt sensitive so we did not use all the Onion Soup mix. I really liked the way the meat tasted....
Great meal to make in a pinch! Thank you for posting!"
280271,37413,2006-10-01,5,"Papergoddess, I really don't think you need another 5 stars. But you are getting it anyway! I was running late for work so took out a pound of ground beef. Ran to zaar to figure out what to fix when I got home. Gave DH two choice's. He said ""Beef patties with gravy sounds like comfort food, can I have that?"" I think he  made an excellent choice. He was like a contented cat and purred the rest of the night. Thanks, for posting."
140132,37413,2007-04-15,5,Comfort food at its best.  This was very good.  I love comfort foods and DH could eat every meal like this....lol.  I will be making this again as it is not only tasty but simple too.  I served this with mashed potatoes and corn.  Thank you so much....Stephanie
369715,37413,2007-12-15,5,These were really good and easy to make. My whole family loved the taste of these. I doubled the recipe but only added 2 cups of water in the gravy. I didn't need to the flour because the gravy thicken up nicely. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Will be making this more often.
173579,37413,2013-03-30,5,This is a very good recipe and so easy to fix.  It is great served with mashed potatoes. Thanks for posting.
4470,1356,2009-04-17,5,"Very tasty recipe.  I did add 1 tsp of hot sauce (I do like spice).
 I cut the peppers long ways - they cook faster and I  did not pre cook them.  25 minutes in 375 oven and they were perfect - still had some crunch to the peppers and totally hot through. Used Lite Havarti cheese.  Thanks for a very enjoyable recipe"
527607,1356,2009-10-28,5,"Add mine to the rave reviews of this.  I have never had such wonderful stuffed peppers, just as they should be but to often aren't.  Not only the flavors, they can be changed as people like but the technique."
140132,1356,2010-11-23,5,"These were very good.  I had some large green peppers and knew I was going to make stuffed peppers with them.  I chose your recipe and am very glad I did.  I doubled the meat ingredients, filled the 6 (very large) peppers and put the remaining mixture in a casserole.  We loved these.  The peppers were nice and thouroughly cooked.  Thank you for sharing we will use this recipe again."
166642,66241,2008-04-05,5,I made these for breakfast this morning and they turned out wonderful! They were so light and fluffy and flavorful. Thanks for sharing!
107135,66241,2006-07-10,5, great recipe .dee
169969,66241,2006-08-09,5,I originally made this recipe for Zaar World Tour 2006 and loved it! I have since made the recipe a number of times. I have decided that what I like best about this recipe is that the pancakes do not have an overwhelming flour taste like some recipes I have had in the past. The pancakes are light and fluffy and are good enough to be eaten without butter or syrup (although who in their right mind would do that!). Soooâ€¦.. Stack â€˜em high!!!  This recipe is great!
173579,66241,2006-11-01,5,These were just wonderful.  The texture was just perfect!  Best I have ever made.  Will be making these many more times.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.
37449,66241,2008-04-08,5,I made these for my DH for breakfast and he really liked them! I had a little taste and love the flavor! Thanks Nimz!
461834,66241,2007-10-28,5,"This were delicious!!  Made them for today's Sunday breakfast along with sausage and eggs.  The texture is great and the consistency is right, in that it is not too thick or thin.  I started out cooking them at 350 on griddle but had to up it to about 375, probably just my old griddle.
Made for potluck tag!!!  Thanks Nimz for another great recipe!!"
8688,66241,2008-01-20,5,"It's no wonder these delicious pancakes have so many 5 star reviews!  They are wonderful! Light, Fluffy and Flavorful!  I did not add the entire amount of flour (used approximately 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups) because we like our pancakes thinner than most recipes. I also prepared this recipe in my blender .  I find it is easier to pour the batter from the blender container when making pancakes or waffles. Other than that, I served with a side of crisp bacon, pure Canadian Maple syrup and blueberry syrup.  Thanks for the wonderful breakfast, Nimz!"
383346,66241,2008-03-01,5,The only change I made was to use vegetable oil instead of butter.  And I omitted the salt.  These pancakes are delicious.  Thanks Nimz :)  Made for Zaar Star Game.
140132,66241,2008-08-04,5,"Wow, these are hands down the best homemade pancakes I've had.  I've tried pancakes from scratch, only to not like the taste.  These are delicious.  Thank you for posting."
386585,66241,2008-08-18,5,Delish!!  Super easy and super tasty.  I'm thinking that you probably don't even need the vanilla extract and they would be good enough on their own.  Thanks for posting!
226863,66241,2008-11-02,5,Fantastic!  Made for Football Tag Game.  I'm so glad I lost so I got to make this great tasting pancake recipe.  These are the lightest and fluffiest pancakes I've ever eaten.  Thanks for posting!
176615,66241,2009-01-18,5,"Excellent pancakes! Fluffy, light  and just the right thickness. Used a Calphalon griddle pan, so no oil was needed to cook. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
573325,66241,2009-02-08,5,"OUTSTANDING Pancake recipe! I've never had a batter that easy to work with. This is so super easy to put together and tastes great! I really love the fluffy texture of these pancakes and their sweet but not overly sweet taste. I think this will be my favourite pancake recipe from now on. Thank you so much for sharing, Nimz!"
452940,66241,2009-04-01,5,"Great buttermilk pancake recipe! I quartered the recipe and got 3 large pancakes. The only con here is that the ingredients are not listed in the order used. Thanks for sharing this light, fluffy, and tasty pancake recipe. :)"
197023,66241,2009-08-21,5,"A fabulously delicious and very easy to prepare pancake recipe. We enjoyed ours with raspberries and generous dollops of creamy Greek yoghurt. As reviewer 129, I add my accolades - and those of my guests who wanted the recipe - to those of earlier reviewers! :) What more is there to say? Except: I'll certainly be making these again.  Made for Zaar Stars Tag."
527607,66241,2009-10-14,5,"wonderrful pancakes, made them for thanksgiving brekkie, easy and delicious"
126440,66241,2011-06-26,5,"Wonderful pancakes!  I had a bit too much oil in my pan and they were crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside.  Great with butter, syrup and sausage."
424680,66241,2011-07-12,5,"Easy to make, & a delight to devour, which we did! Absolutely some of the best buttermilk pancakes I've ever had, & my mom used to make some great ones! Served this time around with some pure maple syrup ~ Couldn't be better! Thanks for posting the recipe! [Made & reviewed as a THANK YOU for playing with us in Please Review My Recipe during the recent tour]"
542159,66241,2011-09-04,5,"Wonderful way to start the day! I cut the recipe in half and still got 6 big fat pancakes that were served with some homemade jam. We will definitely be enjoying these again, thanks for the post."
128473,66241,2012-04-03,5,"Excellent pancakes Nimz.  These were awesome, big, thick, light, tender and fluffy.  The pancakes were so flavorful.  I love buttermilk pancakes and these are some of the best I have ever tried.  Garnished with some melted butter and icing sugar.  They really didn't need anything else. Thanks for sharing another recipe that has gone into my keeperbox. Made for Spring Pac 2012."
1179225,66241,2018-03-28,5,Classic! Wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for posting the recipe.
95743,63828,2005-02-22,0,"Hate to buck the trend here but this didn't work well for me.  I followed the instructions exactly and the roast was, in my opinion, overdone and dry.  It did register precisely at 140 degrees when I removed it from the oven and I had brined it before roasting.  Not sure how to improve my results with this method.  "
140132,63828,2010-06-17,5,Came out perfectly cooked ..... tender adn juicy.
560491,63828,2012-09-11,5,My oven only goes to 500 degrees so set it for that; also my tenderloin was a little over 1 pound so I cooked it for 9 minutes and then turned it off and left the oven closed.  My tenderloin was a little too rare for our liking; not sure if it was under cooked or cooked perfectly but looked under cooked based on how we usually cook it (we may just over cook it usually).  Was very tender and juicy and I just sauteed the slices in a pan for a couple minutes on each side to be sure it was cooked through.  Will use this method again; even with cooking the tenderloin slices afterwards it still turned out more moist and tender than any other way we have cooked it.  Made for Help A Naked Recipe Tag in the Photo Forum.
126440,63828,2014-12-17,5,Turned out great so moist and nice.
47892,150384,2007-08-07,5,"I tried this soup over a month ago and forgot to review it. Very good! The perfect consistency-not too thick and not watery either. I used fresh broccoli from a local farm and Tillamook cheese from Oregon! This is a straight shooter: no Velveeta, onion soup mix, canned cheese soup, etc. We love the hint of nutmeg! Thanks for posting! cg"
199848,150384,2009-11-04,5,"Great soup!  Just the right texture.  The carrots add a nice bit of sweetness.  I made this as written, but streamlined the method to use only one pot.  I used fat free half and half with great success.   This is definitely a keeper; thanx!"
140132,150384,2010-01-12,5,"So good.  I made this last night and it was so good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and blended half the soup and left half ""chunky"".  We loved this.  Its creamy and flavorful.  Thankyou for sharing this with us."
222564,150384,2013-01-11,3,"Lovely, tasty soup. Made with full fat milk, boiled the veggies from the start with the soup, so halved the cooking time. Would leave carrots out next time and increase broccoli."
53932,150384,2013-01-18,5,"Excellent.  Just as a personal preference, I would use less nutmeg next time."
126440,150384,2013-01-22,5,Perfect thickness and creaminess.  Loved it.  Put mine in the blender and served with Russian Black bread.
8688,150384,2013-01-27,5,"This is an excellent recipe.  I cannot compare it to Panera as making it by this recipe is the only way I have experienced this soup.  I made it healthier by using Earth Balance in place of butter, using Better than Bouillon (vegetarian no chicken base) with water instead of chicken stock.  I also used my immersion blender to cream the soup after the vegetables were tender.  The flavor  and texture of this soup is perfect for our taste!  Thank you so much for sharing!  I will definitely make again!"
131126,79944,2004-12-26,5,"Our family loved this recipe!! The chicken tastes wonderful & when finished looks so attractive on the plate. I couldn't find the pre-mixed cream cheese, so mixed dried chives into 2 packages of cream cheese. Everyone raved about this dish.  Thanks Tish for sharing your recipe!"
179133,79944,2005-02-04,5,"Had this for dinner tonight with green beans, squash (#109335) and rolls. Chicken was delish! Was easy to prepare and was very moist and creamy. We didn't broil for the full 5 minutes - didn't need to. Thanks nnreq for a great recipe!"
101823,79944,2005-10-07,4,"I downsized this recipe for only 2 chicken breasts, as I was only serving my husband and myself.  3 tablespoons of cream cheese seemed like a lot for each breast, and I reduced that amount to better suit our tastes.  I also could see no reason for the added butter or salt and omitted them.  My chicken rolled nicely and didn't need toothpicks for securing.  The bacon added a nice flavor dimension to the chicken and creamy filling.  This was simple to prepare and made an easy meal for a weeknight."
140132,79944,2007-01-30,5,I made this as written using thin sliced chicken breasts.  This is delicious although very rich.  My whole family enjoyed this very much.  I am thinking this is a good entertaining recipe as it is a beautiful and delicious. Thank you for a great dish for everyday and special events.....Stephanie
1072593,79944,2010-09-25,5,Da'yum'...this was good!
222564,79944,2011-11-28,5,This is most magnificiently delicious chicken ever!
101823,52035,2003-12-25,4,My hubby loved these.  They were a good addition to my Christmas goodie trays.  Very easy and the presentation (with the chocolate drizzle garnish) is a nice finishing touch.    
89831,52035,2006-12-27,4,"I made these for my xmas holiday tray, warning!... they are extrememly rich and sweet, so I rolled them into very small balls, they were enjoyed by my guests over the holidays, thanks for sharing New Nana!...Kittencal:)"
140132,52035,2010-01-03,5,"I made these with my DD's yesterday and they are so good.  I usually make them for Christmas but we ran out of time so this is the one recipe they said we HAD
to make still.  Thank you for posting, this is truly a keeper."
560491,52035,2010-12-17,5,"These are so good and rich!  I started crushing with my food processor, but then it stopped working; so I dumped the cookies into my stand mixer and let it run for about 5 minutes and then put the cream cheese in and ran for about 2 more minutes.  Surprisingly everything was crushed and mixed up and no big chunks left!  These are easy to make and such a rich treat!  Made for the Christmas cookie trays and the Photo Forums' 2010 Holiday Celebration."
1179225,52035,2011-12-10,5,"I can't believe I've never reviewed these. Everytime I make them they disappear. I make mine smaller only because they're so rich. I agree with others that it's best to crush the oreos either with a rolling pin or food processor, then mix with a mixer. I found using two toothpicks is the easiest way to get them covered with chocolate and then pulled out of the chocolate. They turn out so pretty. Thanks for posting this great recipe!"
222564,52035,2012-12-01,5,Fantastic!
4470,8739,2001-07-24,5,I don't know if I enjoyed the quacamole or the intro to this recipe the most.  Both are great!
41578,8739,2002-08-20,5,"Everyone agreed, this is by far the best Guacamole I have ever made.  Served with tortilla chips and your Cheese Enchilads with Sour Cream Sauce and you have an excellent meal.  Thanks for sharing this.   :-)"
88099,8739,2004-12-26,5,"I know you probably don't need another 5 star, but this was the best Guacamole I have yet to make.  Everyone really enjoyed.  Took it to our family Christmas gathering and it went over well.  Thanks for posting."
158086,8739,2006-03-27,5,"This was the best guacamole I have ever had, and I just got back from the Riviara Maya and ate this stuff every day there...I will be making this alot"
209747,8739,2006-05-24,5,TexMex best! Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
140132,8739,2008-01-28,5,OMG....this is so very good.  I love guacamole and this is the BEST.  DD and I couldn't quit eating this.  Thank you for posting this excellent recipe...Stephanie
37449,8739,2008-08-14,5,"I scaled this recipe down for 1 avocado. I love cilantro, but didn't have any so left that out. I had it on 9-grain toast and it was so yummy! Thanks Mark!"
8688,8739,2008-12-21,5,So delicious and so simple to prepare on the spur of the moment!  I served with recipe#131176. Thanks Mark for sharing this recipe : )
386585,8739,2009-04-16,5,"I have never made homemade guacamole before, and this recipe had me looking like a pro!  I will definitely be making this often."
58104,8739,2009-04-27,5,"Mark, You know how to get one attention!! I did use chopped cilantro & 1 diced jalapeno pepper. We do like it HOT! I didn`t have any tomatoes because I just made my Smoking Salsa recipe #70375 with the last of my garden tomatoes so I replaced the tomato with 1/2 cup salsa. So yummy creamy good! Do use the skin as well! No I really mean don`t forget the skin of the avocado can be rubbed on rough skin surfaces(elbow,knees, Or even do a face mask)"
126440,8739,2009-08-09,5,"Great Guacamole.  I made it for 2 and it went fast.  Our jalapeno was spicy, oh so good."
1179225,8739,2012-12-10,5,The perfect classic guacamole!
593927,8739,2013-02-25,5,"I like a bit more garlic but this is a nice version of guacamole. I used prefect avocados and I loved the crushing with a big spoon and the texture it gave the final product. I used the greater amount of organic garlic, sorry but I used less than half a lemon which I love generally adding even more, plum tomato, regular onion, sea salt and the optional cilantro (a small hand full, would add more next time) for it's detoxing of heavy metals and just love it anyway! Made for Healthy Choices Tag Game 2013%u200F."
8688,66121,2007-04-22,5,"Tish, we enjoyed this immensely!!  I used one ribeye steak and two filet mignon   which was so tender and delicious in this recipe.  I think I ended up using too much cornstarch, which I will make a point of not doing next time, because the sauce became too thick, but delicious none the less.  This is a very simple recipe and very quick to prepare serve with rice.  I will be making this again and again!  Thank you so much, Tish : )"
158086,66121,2007-11-01,4,"This was very good and very easy to prepare, I did use sugar free brown sugar and thicken it up with cornstarch...turned out great.."
88099,66121,2009-03-06,5,"I haven't had P.F. Chang's Mongolian Beef, but this was very good.  It did take me longer to make it than stated but I was also making egg drop soup.  I missed having some vegetables along with the meat.  May add that next time and some crushed red pepper flakes to kick up the flavor for us.  But made as written and was very pleased.  Thanks Tish."
222564,66121,2009-03-11,5,"5 stars all the way! I did use 1 tbs ginger, as we just love it, and only 1/2 cup brown sugar, but these are just personal preference."
140132,66121,2010-01-06,5,"Fantastic!  I made this tonight and my family and I devoured it.  I did read the reviews and cut back on the brown sugar, by half.  The meat is so tender and flavorful.  I added one whole bunch of green onions and it was perfect.  I served this with fried rice and hot and sour soup.  thank you for sharing this restaurant quality meal."
400708,66121,2010-01-28,5,"This is one great recipe, fairly easy to put together and a wonderful taste.  Never had it at PF Chang's but sure enjoyed it at home.  I did follow Williamwhy's suggestion and added a small amount of sesame oil and then marinated the meat in the sauce for 2 hours prior to frying.  I think it did help to increase the flavor level.  I think next time I'll just pan fry the beef also as deep frying didn't seem to make much differance.  Served this with steamed rice and a side of recipe#12563 - YUMMY!!!"
176615,66121,2012-04-03,5,"The family loved it! Tastes just like the original. I doubled the recipe and would highly suggest doing so. Easy to make. Thanks, Tish, for sharing the recipe!"
1179225,66121,2012-11-14,5,"Totally satisfied the craving for PF Changs!  I was craving Mongolian beef like CRAZY! I'm completely ignoring the nutritional facts, because I had to have it. I used the whole bunch of green onions and used less brown sugar and it turned out great! Thanks for sharing the recipe."
486725,66121,2013-11-09,5,"Excellent. The sauce is not quite exactly like PF Chang&#039;s, but it is still a delicious dish and definitely repeat worthy. I did not deep fry the meat, halved the soy/water (it was still plenty) and used only 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar (so it would not be sweet for us). Next time I would also increase the aromatics, maybe add more flavors to increase the complexity of the sauce, and add the cornstarch to the sauce instead of the meat, to avoid the mess that created. I think this would work equally well to halve the meat and add veggies to it too. A thoroughly enjoyable meal!"
136997,80536,2005-01-18,5,This was fabulous! Very rich tasting. I added a little more garlic as we love it. Served with the egg noodles as suggested and a side salad. YUM! 
158086,80536,2005-09-26,5,Made this for Sunday dinner...turned out very good...I put in a little quick tapioca the last hour to thicken and it turned out perfect.
8688,80536,2007-12-16,4,"We enjoyed this so much.  The beef was nice and tender and the sauce had a surprise sweetness which enhanced the flavor of the stew.  I used baby carrots which helped ease the prep work and served with the suggested side of buttered egg noodles.  Next time I make this, I will reduce the amount of the hoisin sauce.  Thank you so much, Evelyn!"
369715,80536,2008-01-25,5,This was very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as far as the ingredients but I put everything in the crock pot and cooked it for 6 hours. It was so moist. It also smelled so good when I came home from work. Everyone really enjoyed it.
222564,80536,2009-03-06,5,Unique with some hoisin sauce and very delicious!
126440,80536,2009-10-23,5,Great stew.  I made half a recipe and it was perfect for the two of us with a little left over.
140132,80536,2012-02-08,5,Oh my goodness this is wonderful.  I made this tonight with some homemade bread and it was delicious.  It had a distinct flavor from the hoisin sauce that is like no other stew I've made.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us.
305531,80536,2016-11-04,5,"This was a delicious stew that I really enjoyed. Thanks for sharing, Ev."
88099,56103,2003-07-12,2,This was an okay dish but highly over rated.  I don't think it is a 5star recipe.
101823,56103,2003-11-16,5,"Hubby and I had these tonight as a side with roasted chicken. Hubby had no complaints, as brussel sprouts are one of his favorite vegetables.  I ate more brussel sprouts than chicken!  The roasting process really brings out a delicious flavor.  I don't usually use much salt, but added a good pinch of coarse kosher salt prior to roasting and a little more after.  I will definatly make these again."
80353,56103,2003-11-28,5,"Yum!  I am a devotee of sprouts and hoped to turn my family on to them.  Well, I got to enjoy the whole pan to myself!  Brown and crunchy on the outside, with a sprinkle of salt, smooth and creamy inside.  I had half for dinner yesterday and half for breakfast this morning (I only made up a half batch of the recipe).  This didn't turn my family onto sprouts, but that's not the recipe's fault.  I just have to accept the fact that some people will just never like Brussels Sprouts :-( and only make them for myself :-)"
4470,56103,2003-12-18,5,  I have forced myself and taught myself to like veggies and I eat at least two fresh ones every day but with this recipe I LOVE Brussels Sproats!   It truly gives a different dimension to sprouts. Thank You Laura Lee and my iron seeking body thanks you too
67656,56103,2004-11-26,3,"With so many great reviews, I was a little disappointed with this dish. The lemon flavor was just a bit too strong for my taste. If I were to make this again, I would do a little less lemon pepper and a little white pepper or a smidge of garlic powder. "
176615,56103,2004-12-04,5,"Amazingly simple and wonderful! The recipe as stated is quite good, also the suggestions in the other reviews for a drizzle of balsamic vinegar or parmesan are super, even plain with olive oil and kosher salt is quite tasty. I've made them with fresh and frozen brussel sprouts with good results. "
95743,56103,2005-02-20,5,This may be my new favorite way to prepare Brussels sprouts.  I cut them in half and they roasted in about 20 minutes.  So easy and simple.  Terrific taste.
158086,56103,2006-01-11,5,Fabulous way to make brussel sprouts....smells up the house but well worth it....
280271,56103,2006-11-12,5,"Great new way to cook brussel sprouts. Quick and easy. I will be making this again. Really liked the flavor and ease of preperation. Mine also came out on the dark side. Next time may try cooking on a lower temp. and less time. Thanks, Sharon123 for posting this tasty dish."
53932,56103,2007-01-12,5,I agree with everyone else.  These are excellent.
89831,56103,2007-02-02,5,"So so so good! I have made these before but this is a first using lemon-pepper seasoning, will be making again, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten:0"
157425,56103,2007-12-25,5,"Loved these brussels sprouts! I also used frozen than roasted in the oven for about 15 minutes. Used a little more lemon pepper seasoning, my favorite, and a sprinkle of kosher salt. Next time I think I would leave the salt out for my taste. Sharon great recipe, thank you!"
226863,56103,2008-12-03,5,"Delicious!  I was a little scared when I saw how dark the brussel sprouts were getting, but they tasted great!  I loved them.  Thanks so much for posting a recipe I'll make again and again!  Made for Everyday is a Holiday Tag!"
133174,56103,2010-01-17,5,I can well understand why these have so many wonderful reviews.  The perfect way to prepare fresh sprouts.  Thanks Sharon for a wonderful new side.
369715,56103,2010-10-15,4,Good and easy to make. Followed the recipe as written using pepper and not the lemon pepper as that is all I had.
486725,56103,2013-01-31,5,"Wow, so awesome! I love that this is super quick and easy and they come out so brown and crispy and delicious. I used fresh brussels sprouts (I can't imagine it would work well with frozen). I didn't measure the oil, but probably got away with halving it. 35 minutes seemed to be perfect for whole brussels sprouts. I can see why this went into someone's best of the year cookbook!"
323186,56103,2013-11-18,5,"Lovely way to do an old favourite,  and so easy :)    Thank you Sharon, made and enjoyed for PRMR tag game"
482376,56103,2014-02-06,5,Delish! Super easy and very flavorful. I just love roasted Brussels sprouts and this recipe was a winner. Thank you!
128473,56103,2014-02-10,5,"Wow, wow, wow Sharon.  I am not a huge fan of Brussel sprouts, but I may be now.  These little sprouts were oh so lovely, soft, tender, slightly sweet with a nice dark outer skin that had a great bite.   Made exactly as written wouldn&#039;t change a thing. They were so quick and easy to make, I know that we will be enjoying these again.  Made for the Best of 2013, Kudos to you for making it into my Best of Cookbook for 2014."
386585,56103,2014-02-18,5,"So, so good!  Good enough to convert the haters to lovers!  The only thing I would caution is to check the ingredient list on your lemon-pepper seasoning to make sure it doesn&#039;t contain salt.  I didn&#039;t realize that what I happened to have did.  Luckily I caught it, or I would have had some salty sprouts!"
1179225,56103,2014-11-23,3,"This recipe didn&#039;t work out too well for me. The brussels turned out dry on the outside and mushy inside. I think they should have come out 10 or 15 mins. sooner, but then they may have lost the roasted flavor. These just weren&#039;t for us. Thanks for posting the recipe. It&#039;s always fun trying new things."
160974,52272,2006-10-07,4,"This was indeed fabulous clam chowder. I omitted the dill and used some fresh garlic, black pepper, and dried parsley. I used a previous reviewers suggestion and used 1 cup fat free half and half and the rest low-fat milk. I cooked my potatoes separately and put everything into the slow cooker to heat. This was fast and tasty.  Thanks Teen!

400708,52272,2007-10-21,4,"Made this on a cool fall evening and served with recipe #70470, yummy.  I made it exactly as directed and DH and I truly enjoyed it.  Only thing I would try next time is to cut the bacon in half (personal preferance) as we felt it overpowered the clam taste a little and we like the clams.  But will sure make it again.  We did have quite a bit left over (only 2 of us) so froze the remainder in individual containers and when we took it out to reheat on the stove, no problem and very good, though not as good as creamy and thick as the first time.  Thanks teen for a great recipe."
8688,52272,2007-12-22,5,"For being such a simple recipe, this provided excellent results!  I made this using all ingredients I had on hand and served with a tossed green salad and crusty Italian bread.  Thanks for sharing!"
126440,52272,2008-12-04,5,"Made this delicious recipe and served with Recipe #98636 Cheese and Garlic Drop Biscuits. It is very thick and delicious.  I only had minced clam, so added a can of crab.  Still have some left for lunch."
140132,52272,2009-02-10,4,"This was good and very simple to prepare.  I made this on a cold and wintery day and was very happy.  This was thick and rich and very good.  I will continue to make this recipe, we all enjoyed it. Thank you for posting."
53932,52272,2009-08-28,5,"I used fresh clams and thought this was terrific.  I was a little hesitant to use canned soup, the taste was not prominent. I did substitute one can of cream of onion and one of cream of mushroom as I didn't have (and don't like) cream of celery.  I also substituted 2 cups of half and half for the cream and milk.  I did not think the dill was discernible and added a little more upon serving as I love dill."
222564,97496,2006-07-20,4,"Goody, goody! I made crispy cookies by flattening the dough balls flat with a fork and baking few extra minutes. They crack in oven and that makes nice cinnamon stripes on top. Must try them as soft balls, next time. "
227978,97496,2010-01-29,5,"Snickerdoodles are such a classic cookie, and this really was a wonderfully soft Snickerdoodle cookie.  I'll make these again.  Thanks Juju Bee."
140132,97496,2010-06-19,5,Ohhhh....cinnamony goodness.  We love snickerdoodles but I've never tried to make them.  I decieded to give it a go last night and they were delicious.  Simple to prepare and took no time at all.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.
176615,97496,2010-11-07,5,"Fabulous! These are the best Snickerdoodles. I never use shortening in cookies and loved that this recipe called for butter. The flavor was so much better than other recipes, and the texture was cookie-perfect, not too soft or too crunchy. Very pretty cookie and very popular with my kids. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1179225,97496,2014-04-07,5,"5 stars! Light, buttery, just a great recipe. Thanks for sharing this delicious keeper recipe!"
400708,97496,2014-07-25,5,"Made this at a special request.  Turned out soft, chewy and cinnamon sweetness.  Loved them and easy to make."
4470,29544,2002-07-17,5,"Had company for dinner - hot, muggy day so crockpot it is! Well this recipe went over in a big way. The scent from it while cooking is heavenly and lets people know they are in for a treat. I served it with new tiny potatoes and the sauce over them was great Thanks Kari for an easy hot day, any day tasty meal
 UPDATE: When I made these chops I had some sauce left over which I froze. Well last night I just browned 2 skinless chicken breasts, poured this sauce over them simmered until cooked and served the breasts with the sauce poured over plain noodles - another great meal from the same great recipe"
8688,29544,2002-07-23,5,"Well Kari, we POPPED!  These pork chops are so incredibly moist and tender you will need no fork! They reminded me of a sweet and sour flavor of a dish I have made many times before.  I followed the directions to the letter and served over rice.  The sauce this recipe makes is heavenly. An irresistible dish I will undoubtedly make again and again!  Thanks, Kari!"
17803,29544,2003-04-29,5,This was easy to make and the aroma as it was cooking was wonderful.  I used 6 Iowa Chops and turned it on high for 5 hours came out great.  I enjoyed the hint of sweetness in the sauce not overpowering.  Our kids like this and DH was glad to have a hot meal when he came home late from the field.  Thank you for sharing.
140132,29544,2006-12-15,5,This recipe reminded me of swiss steak.  We really enjoyed this.  We ate it with mashed potatoes.  I only used one onion and it was plenty for us. Great flavor and so simple to put together.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  Stephanie
400708,29544,2007-01-25,5,"WONDERFUL; it was differant from the pork chop recipes I usually use, much better and flavorful.  Kind of reminds me of Salisbury Steak but better.  Pork was very moist and tender and the best part was how it cooks without me being there to watch it.  I really liked the idea of using the corn starch to thicken at the end & had lots of sauce left over (only did 2 chops) and froze that to use as a gravy at a later date.  The only two changes I made was pre-browning & sauting the meat & vegies as I'd seen on other post, and instead of 1 large green pepper, used 1/2 green and 1/2 sweet red pepper. Veggies & meat where perfect when done.  Served over steamed white rice with hot dinner rolls & a bottle of our favorite red wine - YUM!   Thanks for great recipe, it's a keeper and will be used again.  Next time I'll serve hot sour dough bread with it."
80353,63689,2003-08-20,5,"These really are good sloppy joes and much-enjoyed by my kids (who got as much on them as in them).  Spicy, but not over-the-top, making them very kid-friendly.  "
88099,63689,2004-09-08,4,"These were wonderful.  I also cut down on the celery as someone suggested, using only 1 stalk and it worked out fine.  Also added a little more barbecue sauce.  Thanks for posting."
173579,63689,2004-11-19,5,My family loves these.  They have wonderful flavor. 
160974,63689,2004-12-22,5,"I thought this was a very satisfying sloppy joe. I accidentally grabbed a bag of frozen sausage (instead of beef) but it was really good, and the taste was slightly better than hamburger! If you have some meat cooked/frozen you can make this in five minutes.

Roxygirl in Colo."
222564,63689,2006-10-14,4,"There's no taste lacking here! Very well flavored dish, that we had with home made Tasty Buns, Oven Chips, Coleslaw and some sliced tomato and it was all a treat."
8688,63689,2007-04-24,5,"It's no wonder this recipe has so many excellent reviews! I am sorry it took so long for me to try it!  This recipe is so easy to make with ingredients that most everyone has on hand at all times. I made this using Jack Daniels Honey Smokehouse Barbecue Sauce and I followed your excellent directions exactly.  My husband had 3 so I know, I will be making this a lot! This is a great recipe, Hey Jude!!  My husband and I thank you : )"
169969,63689,2007-09-12,5,Quick and Easy. Our 5 year old loves these in his lunch box the next day! Thanks for posting.
176615,63689,2007-12-25,5,Delicious! The first sloppy joes my kids have ever gobbled down. My pickiest child ate two! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!
140132,63689,2008-01-19,5,Very good.  My family loves sloppy joes and this one fits the bill.  Thank you for posting these....STephanie
101823,63689,2008-04-27,5,"I omitted the celery due to personal preference.  I just don't care for cooked celery, in most cases.  Also, I used spicy steak seasoning instead of regular salt and pepper.  My husband is fussy about his sloppy joes and bristles when he sees the brown sugar come out, as he doesn't care for an overly sweet sandwich.  These were great.  Love that they use ingredients that are always in my pantry and fridge."
126440,63689,2013-01-30,4,"Did the pizza Joe's.  Very good, quick easy and simple."
204024,63689,2013-09-30,5,This made a good early dinner for us on this dark and stormy day. Easy and delicious.  Made for Name that Ingredient Tag!
560491,63689,2013-10-04,4,"This was very good!  Made as written but only added 1 celery stalk so DS wouldn&#039;t freak out... I think next time I will decrease or even leave out the vinegar, to me it was too prominent.  Served on hot dog buns because apparently I was out of burger buns!  Made for Name That Ingredient Tag."
47892,63689,2014-02-04,4,"My family devoured these! Used local beef and subbed marinara sauce for the tomato sauce and ketchup. The homemade BBQ I used had all the remaining ingredients in your recipe: brown sugar, mustard, etc. so I skipped adding those ingredients. The mixture was served over dinner rolls I picked up at a local bakery. Served with a tossed salad. Very good and very easy! Made for Best of 2013."
461834,63689,2014-02-05,5,"Nice and simple recipe for sloppy joes!!!  I scaled this back to 1/4 of the recipe, but followed as written for the recipe.  I just bought some celery the day before, it was very fresh and green and even after simmering for 45 mins., it was still crunchy when I ate my lunch, but that isn&#039;t the fault of the recipe but rather the super freshness of the celery.  My recipe is very similar but includes green pepper, which I did miss and would add it next time.  I used &quot;Montgomery Inn&quot; bbq sauce so it had a little kick which was nice.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for &quot;Best of 2013 Tag Game&quot;."
41578,27210,2003-08-15,5,"I let the pork chops marinate about 8 hours before grilling.  WOW, what a wonderful flavor!!!  The combination of ingredients were perfect.  Thank you so much!
"
4470,27210,2004-07-09,5,Truely these are super - The picture says it all - I marinated them for about 3 hours.  They BBQ perfectly This is a do again recipe - can 27 reviews be wrong? Thanks Kate in Ontario for an easy excellent recipe
173579,27210,2005-10-06,5,Excellent flavor.  I only marinaded mine for 2 hrs and thought that was plenty.  Thanks for posting such a tasty recipe.
140132,27210,2007-04-05,4,This was good and we will use this recipe again.  I love grilled chops and your marinade was the perfect flavoring for them.  Thank you for a great chop recipe....Stephanie
461834,27210,2007-05-20,3,"I made this using two very large pork steaks(1 1/2 lbs) and followed directions exactly as stated. Its was way too peppery for us, we were not able to eat it, due to the overpowering pepper flavor. I think if I cut back to maybe one tablespoon or less of the lemon pepper, this would be a tasty recipe. Thanks for posting this recipe that I will try again but with changes."
482376,27210,2007-06-08,5,"These were incredible! My husband said that they were restaurant quality. I used Mrs. Dash lemon pepper and the amount was perfect and tasty. I would not change a single thing in this recipe. EASY..just mix the marinade ingredients into a large ziplock bag, put the pork chops in and leave it in the fridge until it's time to grill. I marinated them in the morning before going to work. When I got home, all I had to do was fire up the grill and make a salad..voila!! *Note - I had bought a pork loin and had the butcher slice into 1 inch chops. I would highly recommend doing this, as the outcome was succulent!*
Outstanding..you really should try this recipe!"
133174,27210,2009-08-26,5,"I can well understand why this recipe has so many wonderful reviews.  The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and the chops were in the marinade all day.  They were tender, flavored and nicely seasoned.  The lemon pepper was reduced considerably.  This is a recipe I will make again."
126440,27210,2011-07-01,5,Wonderful pork.  I marinated for 6 hrs. and then cooked as directed.  Turned out great and served with vegetable kabobs and grilled packet potatoes.  DH loved this meal.
53932,27210,2011-07-10,4,These were very tasty and moist.  The lemon pepper I used was a tad overpowering so I would cut back on that next time.  I think the marinade would be fine with less oil too.
1179225,27210,2011-08-06,5,"Hooray! I have now foud the BEST chop marinade. We loved this recipe. I used Penzey's Florida seasoning, only using just shy of 2 tablespoons, and let them marinate for about 8 hours. They came out perfect. Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe."
101823,29884,2006-05-25,5,"Very good enchiladas.  I prepared the beef version and really liked the seasoning.  Instead of frying the corn tortillas, I wrapped them in foil and warmed in the oven prior to rolling around the filling.  Easy and tasty is a winning combination for this recipe."
280271,29884,2007-05-10,5,"1/28/2006 This is a keeper. Easy, Easy, Easy. Has a great flavor and makes wonderful leftovers for lunch the next day. I made it with the beef and used flour tortilla. I followed Shari2 advice and used 2 cans of enchilada sauce. (I like the hot) Next time I'll try the chicken. 5/8/2007 Made this again using the chicken and threw in some sliced fresh jalapeno's and about 1/2 cup of black beans that I had left over. Thanks for posting IBShirley"
158086,29884,2007-11-06,5,"We really liked these, I used the new whole wheat flour tortillas and they turned out great....will put this recipe in my faves...thank you"
222564,29884,2008-01-03,5,Very comforting food and easy to make. I added some green chilies for heat.
140132,29884,2008-01-16,5,"Very good.  For years, I've used my own recipe for enchiladias but wanted to try something different.  This is so good.  We really liked this recipe alot.  I served this along with #149952 Smoky Refried Beans , #17126 Quick Spanish Rice, and used #31811 Enchiladia Sauce. This was a delicious meal. Thank you so much for our wonderful meal....Stephanie"
173579,29884,2011-02-19,5,Great recipe.  Easy to prepare and very flavorsome.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for posting.
160974,28768,2004-10-14,5,"I've made similar tasting sauces, but what sets this recipe apart is the wonderful texture. The lasagne sets up beautifully and cuts like a dream. I did add a can of tomato paste water. I think the cottage cheese makes it more creamy than the ricotta, too."
37449,28768,2006-12-09,5,"My daughter and I made this for a dinner which her new boyfriend attended. He was impressed and everyong enjoyed it. Left out the sausage, used canned spahgetti sauce. Thanks Di!"
140132,28768,2007-06-22,5,"I made this the other night and it was the ""best ever"".  We love lasagna and have tried many.  Its not that we dont like the others but haven't quite found ""the"" one.  Well now we have found ""the"" one.  This is a great tasting casserole that i served with a lettuce salad and garlic bread.  Superb........Stephanie"
158086,28768,2008-02-14,5,"I made this last night for company...it was wonderful, and it held up great when you cut into it...I had a lasagna that the layers fall apart when you cut into it....I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese"
126440,28768,2010-05-13,5,"I made this again using Recipe #347336 for the sauce(I had it in the freezer).  I put some of the sauce over the noodles and then topped with the cheese.  Excellent lasagna.  I had to make due with what I had on hand because of the nearly four feet of snow we have.  Only had 15 oz. of ricotta, and six oz. tomato paste.  I may save some sauce to put on top of the last layer of noodle then top with cheese as mine were very tough."
1179225,28768,2012-12-25,5,"Yep! It's the best lasagna ever! I think we have a new tradition for Christmas dinner. I assembled it yesterday. I used 1lb. of ground turkey and 1lb. of spicy pork sausage, cottage cheese and added a little more seasoning to that mixture, crushed tomatoes instead of whole. I only had one can of tomato paste, and used no boil noodles. I added about a up and a half of water to the sauce as per the directions on noodle package . I like sauce on the top, so I just saved some to use on top. I baked it covered for 1/2 hour and uncovered for 15 mins. It came out PERFECT! Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe."
41578,54351,2004-12-02,5,"I too like a chewy cookie and these are wonderful.  I used 2 sticks of butter and the 2 cups of oatmeal (to heck with ""healthy"", ha, ha.)  Everyone loved these cookies and I will make them again and again.  Thanks so much, Roxygirl in Colorado.
"
37449,54351,2004-12-19,5,Another 5 stars! I made these to give for Christmas along with chocolate chip and molasses cookies. Yummy and easy to make. Thanks Merrie!
5060,54351,2008-01-22,5,"A wonderful cookie! I got 65, guess I made mine a little bigger.
Lovely crunch and flavour. I used splenda both brown and white and used walnuts for the nuts as that was what I had.  Love the combination of raisins, nuts, cinnamon and oatmeal!! I will make these again, thanks for posting!"
176615,54351,2009-10-31,5,"Excellent! Chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside, just perfect the way a cookie should be. Made as suggested, using 1/2 cup toasted wheat germ and all butter. Was amazed what a difference whacking the cookie sheet on the counter made, and surprised I'd never heard this before! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
140132,54351,2011-08-07,5,"This recipe is wonderful.  I made these last night for DH to take on his business trip this week, knowing that I and DD's don't like raisins.  Well..... after tasting the cookies, we LOVED THEM.  Even with the raisins in them they are the best cookies.  I love how chewy and gooey they are with a great flavor.  So, not sure if the first batch will make it and I will have to make another before tomorrow!  ha ha   Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe that we all love."
222564,87782,2011-07-28,5,Fantastic recipe!
8688,92095,2004-06-29,5,"These meatballs were excellent, Allie!  I made them to go along with your sauce and the combination made a delicious supper! I changed nothing about the recipe and used Parmesan.  Thanks, Allie!"
140132,92095,2008-01-08,5,Delicious....perfect meatballs...thank you.
53932,92095,2009-11-14,4,Good meatballs.  I think next time I would add more salt and fresh garlic.  I baked mine in a 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes.
369715,92095,2009-12-19,5,These were good and easy to make. They smelled so good cooking. I doubled the recipe and used Ragu marinara sauce. Next time I would make my own marinara sauce. We ate a few for dinner and I froze two packages of meatballs for later dinners. It was so awesome to be able to put the meatballs directly in the sauce and not have to cook them in the oven first. Will be making again.
166642,92095,2011-01-10,5,Very good meatballs. So simple yet delicious! Thanks for sharing.
126440,92095,2011-07-13,5,"So tender and great flavors.  I did use half beef and half pork and sauteed for a couple min. on both sides then put into my sauce.  Served with homemade ravioli, french bread and Maggiano's salad."
39835,44888,2002-11-26,5,"Delicious! I used a chicken drumlets and chicken legs instead of chicken wings, garlic salt instead of garlic and regular salt and got rave reviews for this simple-to-make chicken dish. My ds couldn't stop eating these! We will definitely be making these again soon. Thanks for posting this delicious keeper recipe."
131126,44888,2004-09-13,5,"How many ways are there to say yummy?  This recipe is wonderful!!! The chicken has an incredible flavor that impressed everyone it was served to. I did add 1t of red pepper flakes and marinate for 6 hours as I decided to use 18 drumsticks instead of wings. The only hints I would give is to make plenty of these...they will go fast,  and to have wet wipes available if you are serving outdoors. Great recipe!!!"
4470,44888,2006-03-10,5," I have had a rather busy week so haven't fussed a lot with recipes -   I wanted some wings saw your recipe and decided that this iwas easy and sounded good - it has all the flavors I love and did not let me down -    -  Thanks Theresa Thunderbird for posting this delicious, easy & tasty recipe"
158086,44888,2007-02-04,5,These were a big big hit at my sunday dinner....I used sugar free honey and they turned out fabulous...I too cooked minea half hour first and drained...
140132,44888,2008-01-20,4,"We liked these.  I poured the fat off the pan after about a 1/2 hour and that seemed to help.  I think it needs that ""something"" else though.  We are going to make these again and maybe ""tweak"" it to fit our personal tastes, but good base recipe....thanks, Stephanie"
160974,44888,2008-09-29,5,"We enjoyed this marinade on wings and chicken breasts. We used our gas grill to cook these.  Thanks Theresa, for posting.
Roxygirl"
386585,44888,2010-02-09,5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  After reading some suggestions, I did initially bake the wings at 350 for 30 minutes, then followed the recipe at 375 for 1 hour, turning the wings perfectly.  They were caramelized, and not soupy at all.  The perfect treat for our Super Bowl feast."
176615,51537,2006-12-25,0,"This crust gets lots of points for using oil rather than shortening, lard, or butter. Texture is somewhere between flaky and crumbly, not at al tough like some other oil pastries I've sampled. Very easy, especialy since it's mixed in the pie plate. I found the crust too thick for my tastes, and would probably reduce the ingredients by about 25%. Would also reduce the salt. I prebaked the crust for a cream pie without any problems. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
8688,51537,2007-06-03,5,"Oh I am so glad to have found this recipe!  This is a cinch to put together, and it is already in the pan.  I used this as a pre-baked pie shell for my Recipe #24591 and it worked beautifully well.  We were unable to eat the pie for 24 hours after it was prepared and the crust's crispiness held up to the task!  I will be making this again, Laurie!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!"
166642,51537,2008-07-16,5,"This is great! It is so easy to put together and the taste is outstanding. I also like the fact that the crust does not shrink when you bake it in the oven. Delicious! I will use this all the time for all the one crust pies I make. I made it with Bev's ""Recipe#24591"", an awesome strawberry pie, btw. Thanks for sharing. Update: I use this pie crust all the time for one-crust pies. I just recently made Karen's ""Recipe#34185"" using this terrific pie crust."
424680,51537,2009-09-20,5,"Made this just because it was mentioned in connection with a quiche recipe I was making! This couldn't be easier & DEFINITELY does make for a tasty crust! A keeper, for sure, with me!"
140132,51537,2009-12-27,5,I used the recipe for our pie for Christmas dinner.  It has great flavor and cut so wonderfully.  I made a buttermilk pie in this and will use it for other cream pies.  Thank yo for this easier then most pie crust.
383346,51537,2010-12-30,5,This is so easy to do.  And the taste is great.  Probably that next time I'll use only 1/2 tsp of salt.  It was a little bit too salty for our taste.  Thanks LAURIE :)  Made for Holiday tag game
173579,51537,2011-04-28,5,This was so quick and easy.  Will use this a lot.  Thanks for posting.
17803,8701,2002-01-04,5,"Ooey gooey good. How do you like that for cooking terms? Take that Julia Child! 

UPDATE: This is the second time I've fixed these. With limited oven space on Christmas, I decided to put them in the crock-pot this time. I used about 7 pounds of ribs to one of the sauce recipe mixture, and cooked on high for 6 hours. They came out just as good but less sticky."
169969,8701,2004-11-15,5,These were so easy to make and were awesome!!! They were gobbled up in seconds flat! I never attempted to make ribs because everyone made them seem so complicated. This dish is fabulous and you are right....It should be Illegal! I made them with Tommy Fries #22641 If there were more stars I would give more. I used real garlic instead of powder otherwise stuck to recipe! Thank you!
140132,8701,2008-04-28,5,"If these were illegal, then take me to jail.....these are amazing!!!!  My family really liked these and I would love add this to my ""repeat recipes"".  I served these with crockpot scalloped potatoes and baked beans.  Thank you for posting....Stephanie"
386585,8701,2008-05-27,5,"These were the best oven-baked ribs I have had yet, although I was not entirely faithful to the recipe.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's regular barbecue sauce as my base, substituted light brown for the dark brown sugar, and omitted the white sugar (I was just afraid it would be too sweet).  Then I tossed in a generous 3 shakes of hot sauce.  I baked them as directed, just running them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up.  Marvelous!!"
280271,8701,2008-10-01,5,"Loved, loved, loved these. Wow are these good. Thanks for posting."
226863,8701,2009-03-15,3,"My dogs give this 5 stars.  However, the human consumers did not.  I am a barbecue perfectionist, so maybe I am judging too harshly!  After reading all the great reviews, I thought that there was a chance I could get good ribs without using my charcoal grill.  It was raining today, so I decided to try this recipe out.  But the semi-dry paste was a liquid, not a paste.  I cooked more slowly as suggested by other reviewers.  I turned them every 30 minutes, to cook them evenly.  The ribs weren't tough, they just didn't have the delicious taste I get when I slow cook them on the grill.  I cooked at 325 for 2 hours, then lowered the temp to 300 for an hour.  They tasted slightly ""burnt"" but were they were tender.  They were ""wet"" from the sauce, but not moist....that is the only way I can describe them.  Not what we expect from our pork rib recipes.  My dogs will be very happy with the leftovers though!  I won't make the ribs again, but I may mix the sauce again for a change from my more vinegary sauce.  It is a nice ""sweet"" sauce...just not a rib recipe I would repeat."
126440,8701,2009-07-18,4,I used this on 2 chicken breasts and baked in the oven for 1.5 hours which was too long for chicken. Good flavor on the sauce.
176615,8701,2010-05-16,5,"Fantastic! Used about 5 pounds of pork spareribs, kept all other ingredients the same. Used 8oz honey (by weight, not liquid measure), Hungarian paprika, and Paul Prudhomme's seafood seasoning (which is hopefully close enough to Old Bay). Grated the onion in the food processor and combined with all ingredients except BBQ sauce. Was afraid I messed it up since it was thin, and was hoping it wouldn't just run off into the pan. Poured the BBQ sauce on top. Used a nonstick roasting pan which worked perfectly. Baked at 325 degrees for four hours without taking a peek, and it came out of the oven absolutely perfect. Did broil the top for a few minutes to get more of a crust but would consider that optional. Excellent sauce, sweet but not too much so, great balance of flavors. Think I've only made ribs a few times, but this was definitely easy enough to do more often. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
128473,8701,2012-06-18,5,"My dh wanted ribs for Father's Day.  So I choose this recipe to try.  So glad that I did.  We really enjoyed the ribs prepared this way.  I baked them in the oven for 3 hours.  They were perfect, tender and fall apart delicious.  The sauce was to die for, sweet, hot and spircy..  Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe."
204024,8701,2013-02-03,4,Ribs were tender and sweet.   Too sweet for me  I would leave out the honey and white sugar next time.  Made for best of 2012.
400708,10125,2013-08-01,5,"My nephew is visiting and needed something for a party he was going to and picked this recipe out from all the others I&#039;d saved.  Made two batches, one with vanilla pudding and chocolate chips and one with chocolate pudding and white chocolate chips.  They are both great.  Left out the nuts as I don&#039;t send those to parties with kids for fear of possible allergies but bet they&#039;d be even better with them.  Will are soft, chewy and delicious."
171790,33921,2008-07-26,5,Another 5 star rating for the collection. I used mixed lentils and spaghetti sauce. DD would like me to try BBQ sauce next time as did some previous reviewers. For the seasoning salt I used Recipe#228396. Thanks for sharing.
1179225,33921,2011-03-18,5,"I'm really excited about this recipe. Made it tonight as written and it was very good. I'm not a vegitarian, but like to eat healthfully. I'm looking forward to adding grated carrots, celery and experimenting with seasonings. Thanks so much for posting!"
452355,33921,2012-11-07,5,"There is a reason this recipe gets so many great reviews...it's fantastic!  A keeper!  Even DH admitted he enjoyed it.  I used red lentils and they cooked so perfectly that they barely needed mashing with a potato masher.  I read other reviewers' comments first so I felt comfortable throwing in about 3 oz of shiitake mushrooms that needed using up (this worked really well) when I added the onions, added the extra egg for moisture (perfect), mixed a favorite BBQ sauce that needed using with 4.5 oz of tomato sauce, then used the rest of the originally 8 oz tomato sauce can over the top of the meatloaf 20 minutes into cooking.  The result was a really delicious meatloaf with excellent consistency.  Served with a salad.  I will be making this many times to come.  Thanks so much for posting."
1072593,33921,2017-10-11,5,"I happen to love this recipe and from the amount of reviews I, also, come here for the intellectual discourse."
140132,129926,2008-12-09,5,Five stars all the way.  We loved these and will make this dish many times over.  I served this with spanish rice and refried beans with tortilla chips.  Thank y ou for a simple chicken dish.
126440,129926,2009-07-05,5,"Very good enchiladas.  I made half a recipe and it was easy and soooo good.  I used leftover roasted chicken and just added it to the onion just to warm through.  Served with Quesadillas for an appetizer, Recipe #117892 and Recipe #303397."
158086,129926,2009-08-26,5,These were the best enchiladas I have ever made.....they were a big hit with my family....I used some turkey meat that I had left over from dinner....worked wonderful....I will be making these alot...
1179225,129926,2010-06-21,5,"Wow! Very rich, creamy and absolutley delicious! I layered mine and froze them. I baked them @ 400, covered with foil for about an hour and half. Turned out perfect! Thanks so much."
222564,129926,2011-03-25,5,"Wow, very simple and very very good!"
176615,129926,2011-04-03,5,"Awesome! The family really enjoyed this! Easy to put together, and I love that it contains no creamed soups which always tasts a little off to me. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
428885,129926,2011-04-18,5,"Great recipe! But alas, I don't need to tell you this...looking at all the informative reviews, this recipe will not let you down. I followed this pretty closely, except after cooking my chicken, I used my smaller food processor to  chop up the meat, the onion, and some jalapenos. Not to much! Be careful here, you don't want baby food. I just used this small chop for about 1-2 seconds, opened up, moved the contents around, and whirled about 1-2 more seconds. Warmed tortillas on non-stick with no-stick spray - and they became soft and pliable. Other then that, you're all set for a lovely dinner/lunch/or pot-luck. Go get em, Mildred....and enjoy! Thanks for posting!"
39835,129926,2012-10-06,5,Delish! I used leftover chicken and light cheese and light sour cream. I also used whole wheat tortillas -- delish and easy to make these lighter changes. Thanks for sharing!
226863,129926,2013-06-23,5,"Loved it!  The only thing I added was fresh cilantro, and these were so good.  So easy to make too!  Thanks for sharing."
400708,129926,2014-11-01,5,"Followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it.  A little different, in a good way; from the usual red or green enchiladas and couldn&#039;t have been any easier.  A mild, creamy sauce set the chicken of so well.  I think next time I might even add some cilantro and jalapenos just for a little kick to see how that works, but it&#039;s perfect just the way it is.  Had a lot left over (there&#039;s only two of us) and have frozen the rest for another meal, will be anxious to see how that works out"
128473,87782,2004-03-31,5,"Thank you Evelyn for posting this wonderful recipe. It was so easy and the potatoes tasted so great.
We had them tonite and I will be making them again real soon. "
6357,87782,2004-03-31,5,"These are Oh so wonderful! Sometimes, I just love to have these on their own. I do add a pinch of turmeric powder and some fresh curry leaves to these. We all love this!"
4470,87782,2004-04-26,5,You bet these are delicious! Loved them and they look great too.. my potatoes were a bit smaller so it only took one hour. Very easy to do recipe.  I got the potatoes ready earlier in the day and marinated them in the oil/water/lemon mixture. Thanks for a do again & again recipe Eveltn
67656,87782,2005-01-22,4,"The lemon and long cooking time set these potatoes apart from the usual roasted potato. While I love garlic, there was just a tad too much oregano for my taste. Will certainly make these again varying the spices to complement the main dish. Thanks Evelyn!"
29196,87782,2005-11-18,5,"Tender, super tasty and easy to make with Ev's instructions. I'm sure these will appear on the table again soon."
197023,87782,2006-06-05,5,"We were absolutely delighted with this totally scrumptious recipe, which we enjoyed with evelyn's Keftedakia (Greek Meatballs) Recipe #59573.  Had the meatballs not been SO delicious, we could all have so easily eaten even more potatoes – and nothing but the potatoes!  They were wonderfully crisp and SO flavoursome – just loved the fabulous blend of garlic, lemon and oregano - and what a bonus that they are NOT over the top in their fat content.  There was enough olive oil for flavour, and the lemon juice added heaps more flavour.  About halfway through the cooking, I added the juice of another half lemon.  No adding water for me: I love the flavour of lemon juice too much for that!  Sensational recipe, evelyn!"
131126,87782,2006-06-06,5,Another hit recipe from evelyn/athens!  I served this with Souvlaki or Shish Kebab recipe #81725 and what a hit both recipes were. 5 stars all the way! 
157425,87782,2006-06-08,5,"Awesome potatoes, a very nice change of pace! I only salted them once and used whole peppercorns. The lemon juice was bottled and I probably used two or three tablespoons. I think our oven temp is off as the potatoes were cooked but did not brown as well as I would have liked them. So good though, we enjoyed! thanks evelyn!"
199848,87782,2006-06-13,5,"Delicious potatoes!  I used red-skinned potatoes and left the skins on.  The whole family commented on the
great flavor (and they smell wonderful, too).  I'll make these again; thanx for sharing.
"
89831,87782,2006-12-17,5,"Okay I'm adding my 5 stars to this, loved these taters Ev! :)"
140132,87782,2007-01-17,5,"Wonderful potato recipe.   I made these last night and my family couldn't get enough of them.  The oregano and olive oil combo with lemon was amazing.  Don't know why I never thought of putting those flavors with potatoes before, but am very glad I tried your recipe.  Thank you so much for an easy delicious recipe......Stephanie"
226863,87782,2007-01-24,5,"Great potatoes!  Simple and easy to make, and it frees you up to take care of other parts of the  meal while it is baking.  Thanks for the recipe."
400708,87782,2007-02-09,5,"Wonderful, and easy too.  I was looking for somethng differant to use up potatoes I had in the pantry and this fit the bill.  My DH is NOT a fried potatoe fan (can you believe that!!) but he raved over these.  So easy too and that was a plus.  They cooked while I got the rest of dinner ready so the cooking time was even a big plus.  Everything came out at the same time and was served hot.  I tried the adding a sweet potatoe to the mix (as another reviewer talked about) and that added just a little extra.  This is a keeper and will do again often.  Thanks for a great recipe."
422893,87782,2007-03-03,5,"Yum, hubby was most impressed, these are a keeper!"
461834,87782,2007-03-15,5,"Very good recipe and it was a nice change from the baked, fried or mashed potatoes.  My fourteen year old son ate half of the dish.  Will definitly make these again."
173579,87782,2008-10-23,5,These potatoes are great!  They are so crispy.  Will defiinately be making these again.  Thanks for posting.
126440,87782,2009-06-29,5,Good potatoes.  Just be sure to use the same size potatoes and cut the into the same size wedges.  Some of mine were burned and not good.  Served with Recipe #256734 and Recipe #66596.
498271,87782,2009-09-04,5,Mmmmm - so good!  These potatoes came out tender on the inside and nice and crispy outside with such great flavor.  I went a little lighter on the lemon and a little heavier on the garlic.  Loved these - thanks for sharing the recipe!
174096,87782,2010-03-04,5,Delicious!  I omitted the salt (personal preference.  Thanks for sharing!
383346,87782,2010-06-12,5,Thanks Evelyn for a great recipe.  I love greek potatoes and it was the first time I made it.  I think I cut my wedges not enough large.  I'll know for next time.  They were crispy a lot but with great flavor.  I made half the recipe.  I used the juice of 1 lemon.  I didn't use pepper.  Made for the Zwizzle Chicks of ZWT
171790,87782,2010-06-15,5,These were a big hit last night! They were made just as written and there were no leftovers. Made for ZWT6 SSaSSy's.
37449,87782,2010-06-23,5,So good! My son and I devoured these taters and wanted more! Thanks! Made for ZWT#6-Family Picks.
176615,87782,2013-08-11,5,"Wonderful! Loved the large wedges. Potatoes were nice and brown on the edges. Used my large Calphalon roasting pan which was perfect. Would suggest making more than you think you need, these kept disappearing from the pan even before dinner was served. Served with pork souvlaki, homemade pita, and tzatziki sauce. Will make again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
169430,205890,2007-01-19,5,"Lainey, these are really excellent. Dh is a happy man with a very full cookie jar. The dough is easy to work with and at 6 1/2 mins (in my oven) the cookies are perfect. Not really browned but baked to an ideal point of soft and toothsome goodness. Dh sends a special ""Thank you""."
383346,205890,2007-09-03,5,So easy to do.  I used half butter and half tenderflake.  I used only 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  So I omitted 1 cup of sugar.  And the taste is perfect and less sweet.  I tried to roll them in sugar and without.  And we prefer to omit rolling  in sugar.  That's a very good recipe.  I'll give it to my parents.  Thanks Lainey :)
88099,205890,2007-09-08,5,Awesome cookies. I made this as directed except used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour. These were so easy to make. Mine had to bake about 12 minutes. Loved these.
41578,205890,2007-10-21,5,"You won't be disappointed with these perfect cookies.  Easy to make too.  They turned out soft yet just enough chewiness to them.  I couldn't wait for them to come out of the oven.  ANOTHER winner, from Lainey6605."
37449,205890,2007-12-08,5,Very good! My DH and I loved them. I baked about 8 minutes. Thanks Lainey! Made for Please Review My Recipe game.
461834,205890,2011-09-19,5,"Fantastic cookies!!!!  I haven't made peanut butter cookies for at least a year and upon tasting one of these, I just kept going and ate 3.  Then my 19 yo DS and his girlfriend came back from classes and they also just loved these cookies.  I made 1/2 of the recipe, but it still made 30 cookies using my cookie scoop.  The only change I made was to add a few shakes of sea salt from my shaker and rather than rolling them into balls and then in sugar, I just dipped my fork into the sugar before making the marks in my scoops, much easier.  Mine cooked perfectly in 7 minutes.  They are slightly crisp on the edges and soft in the middle, just perfect.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe that I will definitely be repeating."

8688,33671,2003-01-22,5,This is a deliciously moist and flavorful chicken recipe.  I don't think it could get any more tender than this! We enjoyed our supper so much this evening!  I prepared the rub the evening before and put the chicken in the refridgerator over night.  The house smelled heavenly all day while the chicken cooked in the crockpot.  I thickened the juices for gravy to serve over mashed potatoes as a side and served with egg twist rolls and a zucchini casserole side dish.  It just doesn't get any easier than this!  Thank you for posting this simply delicious recipe!  I will be making this one again!
4470,33671,2003-09-01,5,"Flavor filled, moist chicken with all the fat cooked out of it - excellent recipe.  The juice that cooked out is totally a jelly and will be put to good use as soup stock.  I used a large fryer and cooked it for 5 hours on low then turned to keep warm for another 1 1/2 hours.  For the last 1 1 /2 hours I added small whole onions to serve as one veggie, also served Garlic Mash Potatoes & steamed fresh green beans.  Wonderful meal.  To night I am have chicken Enchiladas and I know they will be very good filled with this tasty chicken - Thanks Kathydesrosiers"
95743,33671,2004-03-08,5,"Decided to remove the skin from the chicken first, then apply the rub and refrigerate overnight. A 5 pound hen finished on low in 5 hours.  A bit spicy for my taste but perfect for Dh and the juices made an outstanding gravy when thickened with cornstarch and served over mashed potatoes."
176615,33671,2006-04-26,5,"Wonderful! One of the best crockpot recipes around! Chicken is moist and tender with lots of flavor. I used 5 chicken breasts with bone and skin, rubbing some of the spice mixture under the skin before refrigerating overnight. Cooked in my 5 quart crockpot for about 5 hours but I think 4 would have been plenty. Used the time bake on my oven for some macaroni and cheese and had a lovely meal ready when we got home from baseball tonight. Thanks, Kathy, for sharing the recipe!!"
89831,33671,2007-02-03,5,"Kathy, I finally got to make your fabulous crockpot chicken, well I can see why there are so many wonderful reviews on it, it bakes out SO tasty, moist and tender! I browned mine firstly on all sides before adding to the crockpot, I used a 7-pound roasting chicken and used all the spices that were stated in your recipe, I love this and plan on making it many more times, THANK YOU so much for an outstanding recipe!...Kittencal:)"
140132,33671,2007-11-03,5,"This is awesome!!!  I admit I printed this out quite some time ago, reluctant to try thinking that chicken would never roast right in the crockpot.  Well, I tried it and could kick myself for not trying it earlier!!!  LOL  This chicken has terrific flavor and the meat was so moist and good.  I have told all my friends about this recipe and that they had to try it.  We have done this a couple of time now and each time it turns out great....thank you for this easy to do recipe that tasted incredible.....Stephanie"
227978,33671,2008-10-05,5,"Yum yum, yum.  By far, this was the very best crock pot chicken dish I've ever prepared.  And so easy to prepare.  My entire family absolutely loved this recipe, which I will certainly make again--and often.  The chicken was so fork tender, and it was moist and very tasty.  What little leftovers we had will make a great chicken soup for one of the chilly nights ahead of us."
653438,33671,2008-10-31,5,"Made this yesterday for dinner and it was outstanding! We came home and the aroma was wonderful and the meat fell off the bone and was very juicy. I took the other reviews and put onion, celery, garlic cloves and lemon on the bottom of the crock pot and put onion, garlic and lemon inside the chicken. I can't say enough...thank you! 
P.S.  I noticed that I forgot to put the stars on the recipe again.  Sorry and here they are...more if I could."
88099,33671,2010-01-10,5,This is one of the best Whole Chicken recipes I've made in a long time.  The flavor was just outstanding.  I made this in my dutch oven and baked it for 5 hours at 250 as another reviewer suggested and it was falling off the bone tender and moist.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.  :)
560491,33671,2010-04-19,5,Very tasty and easy to do!! I didn't have cayenne pepper so sub'd hot chili powder.  My chicken took about 4 1/2 hours which was not good since it was done about 1/2 hours before dinner.  Just left it in the crockpot with the lid on and turned it off to keep warm.  Was very good when we did sit down to eat.  Made for PAC Spring 2010.
482376,33671,2011-05-14,5,This is probably the best crock pot recipe I've ever tried using a whole chicken. It worked perfectly. The flavor is wonderful. I loved the hint of spice. The chicken is very moist. Straight into my best of the best file it goes. Thank you!
369715,33671,2012-03-12,4,This was good and easy to make. I put my chicken on a bed of onions and used the fajita seasoning as you stated in the notes. It was easy to put together in the morning. Mine cooked up in four hours.
1072593,33671,2015-03-25,5,"Come on over, I&#039;ve got a chicken just coming out of the crockpot. I&#039;m just itching to have someone over for dinner. We can party? Yes??"
37449,8782,2004-06-27,5,"My husband took his first bite and said,""Wow"". So I will be making this again! I only used 1/4 tsp. cayenne and omitted the white pepper, adding a little more black pepper. I rubbed the chicken, then put in the roasting pan, let it marinate about 4 hours, then baked. It was worth waiting for. I added 5 or 6 small roasting potatoes aabout 1 1/2 hours before it was done, rolling them around in the juices. Delicious! Thanks so much for posting this! Next time I think I will try a tbls. of brown sugar with it, and there will be a next time!"
95743,8782,2004-08-22,5,"Beyond a doubt the prettiest chicken I ever roasted.  Certainly one of the top five best tasting, maybe top three.  This will be what I make the next time I need a picnic entree.  Roasted, then wrapped up tightly and refrigerated until needed, this would make perfect carry along finger food.  Followed the recipe exactly (except for the garbage bag).  Be sure to rub a lot of that seasoning under the skin.  "
169969,8782,2005-12-27,5,For the 101th time.... FABULOUS! This chicken has wonderful flavors with a moist and tasty meat. I made a 6.5 pound chicken with hopes there would be leftovers for sandwiches - there was nothing left! The sesoning was perfect. The skin was out of this world perfect! Thanks for posting!
296809,8782,2006-03-20,5,My friend (SusieQusie) made this for me when I lived in Dallas. She had a lrg chicken & an inspired moment ... she combined grapefruit sections w/the onions stuffed in the cavity & it was wonderful.  
133174,8782,2006-11-12,5,"What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said about this wonderful recipe?  I misread the directions and instead of basting every 30 minutes, I basted every hour and it still turned out great.  The chicken was done in the 5 hours and the rub had penetrated the meat making for a well seasoned dish.  The chicken was moist, tender and beautifully golden.  My guests were very impressed."
140132,8782,2010-11-17,5,"Oh my gosh this is good.  I made this for my family and we couldnt get enough.  I loved the seasoning blend and plan on using it often for all our chicken recipe.....grilling , frying, roasting.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us....we loved it."
1072593,8782,2010-12-22,5,"While you were off Christmas shopping, I was here making your Sticky Chicken.  Too bad you missed the smiling faces of my family as the juices ran down their arms."
305531,8782,2011-12-07,5,I've been making this chicken for years. I found a similar recipe on another site way back when and loved it. I gave this recipe to my DD to make as her first meal for her in-laws. Even though she can't cook.....they loved her meal! :lol: Thanks C Chatwin for a winner. Made for Cookbook Tag.
482376,8782,2012-01-31,5,"I was so surprised how well this chicken turned out. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was really fall-off-the-bone tender. We enjoyed the spice mixture, which made the chicken very flavorful and different from my regular roast chicken. Thank you for a great recipe!"
128473,200296,2007-01-10,5,"Wow! Kitten this is so wonderful.  I knew that this chicken dish was  going to be good...but I wasn't expecting that the ranch dressing would impart so much flavour.  We really enjoyed this moist, tender, flavourful and fall apart chicken. Thanks for sharing."
158086,200296,2007-02-25,5,"we really enjoyed this, my company ate it all up and I was afraid I had made too much...."
179133,200296,2007-03-29,5,"This was excellent! I don't cook with chicken breasts much (I prefer dark meat) but this was wonderfully juicy and moist. I used recipe #194229 instead of buying dressing because I needed to use up some buttermilk. Served with Recipe #211781, it made a great, easy, fast weeknight dinner. Thanks KITTENCAL!"
140132,200296,2008-06-22,5,"Delicious.  This is very good chicken.  I like to make chicken breasts in all different flavors and this is right at the top.  DS is not a fan of ranch dressing but liked the chicken anyway.  Thank you for posting this yummy version of chicken breasts, will make often."
169969,200296,2009-02-19,5,This is a 5 for simple and easy! A very fast recipe with very little effort. Our 7 year old loved this the most! Thanks Kitten!
88099,200296,2011-09-11,5,Excellent flavoring.  I used a Bacon Ranch dressing (wonderful) and Panco Bread Crumbs which really made this a crunchy delight.  I did add some Southern Garlic flavoring which I love.  My chicken turned out nice and crisp and very moist on the inside.  I did use a baking rack on top of my baking dish and that seemed to work very well.  Thanks Kitz for sharing.  Made for the diabetic forum September event.
133174,106251,2005-01-06,5,There is nothing that brings out the sweat mellow taste of garlic like roasting.  This dish was quick to put together and required minimal attention while cooking.  I sprayed my casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray to facilitate clean-up. Delicious!
53932,106251,2005-10-16,5,"Very good, even if I did roast at the wrong temperature.  I used less rosemary than indicated as I think the flavor is usually overpowering.  I used about 3/8 tsp pepper and would use less next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe."
163112,106251,2005-11-07,5,"This is quick to prep & most delicious.  Next time I'll use more rosemary & some of the garlic was overdone(hot spots in oven - turn the pan 1/2 way through cooking!) No matter, it was still delicious. The kids FOUGHT over this.  What more can I say?"
95743,106251,2005-12-22,5,"I expected good things from this recipe considering all the five star ratings, but this surpassed my expectations.  This is one of those recipes I'd give 10 stars if I could. It really is perfect with a loaf of crusty bread.  I did use fresh oregano rather than rosemary-just a personal preference.  Loved it. My garlic didn't soften much in thirty minutes-I didn't care, tasted great."
37449,106251,2007-10-04,5,Delicious! I love roasted cauliflower and I love roasted garlic! Thank you Rita!
140132,106251,2007-10-31,5,"This is very good.  I love rosemary and the combination was a great combo.  I will make again b/c it was very simple to prepare...and so tasty, great recipe.  thank you for this....Stephanie"
452355,106251,2008-03-13,5,"DH and I served this for dinner last night with 40-clove garlic chicken (#62088).  We absolutely loved this garlic cauliflower dish!  The only change I made was to add more olive oil to taste (I would say about 1/3 cup).  DH and I liked it so much, we ate the whole thing ourselves (and it is supposed to make 6 servings!).  Thanks, Rita, for this keeper."
424680,106251,2008-05-19,5,"I'm surprised this recipe didn't grab my attention before this, but now that it has . . . THIS IS OUTSTANDING! So easy to make ~ So great tasting! AND, by the way, it's not a matter of not growing up ~ It's just that some of us REALLY ENJOY LIFE [My daughter tells me I'm the oldest teenager she knows, & I haven't been one of those since I hit 20, & that was almost 50 yrs ago!] Anyway, your recipe is great & I'm DEFINIETLY KEEPING IT AROUND! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Pleast Review My Recipe cooking game]"
89831,106251,2008-05-25,5,"delicious! I used more than 16 cloves of garlic and also added in a little cayenne pepper as well as some freshly ground black pepper, simple yet so tastey, thanks for sharing Rita!"
653438,106251,2009-03-10,5,"WOW!  This was a great hit.  I cut the recipe in half and used dried rosemary (that is what I had) and added paprika to the oil, salt and  pepper.  When it came out of the oven I shredded parmesan cheese on top as suggested...wonderful.  Thank you!"
176615,106251,2009-07-10,5,"Oh my gosh, this was fantastic! Only change I'd make would be to double the recipe to have enough leftover for breakfast :) Roasting brings out a creamines in the garlic and cauliflower which is so rich and incredible, it almost tastes cheesy. For sure a guilt-free pleasure. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
498271,106251,2009-12-26,5,"This dish is absolutely amazing!  Wonderful flavor and easy to make.  I put everything except the oil in a zip lock bag in the morning, then just added the oil and popped it in the oven before dinner.  I served this at our Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it so much I made another batch on Christmas Day!  Thanks for posting this recipe!"
226863,106251,2010-01-10,5,"I thought I rated this last night, but I don't see the review, so here it goes again.  This is a 5+ star recipe for me.  I halved the recipe, and I greatly regretted doing so.  I could have eaten the entire head by myself!  This will be a definite repeat for me!  Absolutely loved this!"
482376,106251,2010-02-26,5,"Mmmmm. What a delightful treat this was. I would even eat this as a snack. The roasting with olive oil and the simple flavors of salt, pepper, rosemary and garlic makes the cauliflower an all-star. My only caution...  I typically roast cauliflower so it turns black in spots (call me crazy, but I love it done that way). This does not work well when you have garlic cloves!! I thought I'd add that to my review in case there is someone else out there who takes the cauliflower to that level of doneness. ;)"
542159,106251,2011-02-05,5,Yum!! We loved this fabulous cauliflower and it smelled so good coming out of the oven with all the garlic and rosemary. Made as written and will be making again as this moves into our all-time favorites. Thanks so very much for the post.
8688,106251,2012-04-03,5,"Who Knew?  Who knew cauliflower could taste so good??!!  With all these fantastic reviews I knew I would have to give this recipe a try.  This will definitely be my ""Go-To"" Recipe for Cauliflower from now on!  So easy to do, so very little effort for fantastic results!  Thanks so much, Rita!!"
126440,106251,2012-10-19,5,Love the roasted cauliflower but my garlic was burnt.  Will leave the skin on and cook them that way.
174096,106251,2013-02-16,5,"Yum, this is delicious!  I don' t know if I had a smaller cauliflower or if we just got addicted and ate a lot (very possible), but it was 4 servings here.  This was so easy too - I just prepped and put in the oven and was able to make the rest of dinner.  Wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!  Veggie Swap 55"
296809,106251,2015-01-10,5,"Such an easy-fix &amp; no sml wonder that your recipe has a nearly perfect rating after so many reviews. It quite simply deserves every single star it has gotten &amp; then some. I made it exactly as written, but reduced the temp &amp; cooked it a bit longer than stated. Then I turned off the oven &amp; let it sit there while I finished the rest of our meal. It only got better! I love this recipe! Thx for sharing it w/us. :-)"
8688,24672,2002-06-17,5,"Another Inez Willenborg Classic I simply had to try.  The results as always, fabulous!  This is a sweet, delicious treat that you will not need to serve with ice cream. No need to change the recipe.  It's perfect as is!  Chalk up yet another winner for Inez!"
176615,24672,2005-04-24,5,"Delicious! The only change I made was to use 2 quarts of strawberries with the same amount of sugar. I like lots of fruit and had some really beautiful berries. Also, my kids can go through a quart of strawberries on their own, I wanted the rest of us to get some, too! Thanks, MizzNezz, for a yummy dessert!"
95743,24672,2005-06-02,5,"The last thing this recipe needs is another review, but... 
It's to-die-for.  I'll cut back 1/4 of the sugars next time. If you're craving strawberry shortcake -  this is luscious.  It'll hit the spot, for sure."
461834,24672,2007-04-10,5,Excellent strawberry shortcake.  I made this several weeks ago and just now noticed that I didn't write a review.  This was very easy and just delicious.  I made it in a trifle bowl and it look wonderful!!!  Thank you for a great recipe MizzNezz.
140132,24672,2007-04-13,5,Oh my goodness....a cross between cheesecake and angel food cake.....yummy.  It was like two desserts in one...lol.  I made this for Easter and it was gone before the end of the evening.  I kept the strawberries on the side and let people add as many as they wanted.  I will be making this again and not just for holidays.  Thank you.......Stephanie
204024,24672,2012-07-08,4,Pretty strawberries and delicious cake.  I had a hard time trying to make it cut into squares.  Made for Photo Forum Circus.
126440,24672,2012-05-08,5,Made half a recipe and used sponge cake.  Excellent!
128473,32147,2004-06-02,5,What a great recipe...Thank you so much for posting MizzNezz. I made these last night and they are incredible....I don't have a slow cooker...so I browned the ribs really really well....then I cooked them ontop of the stove on low for 4 hours...They were wonderful...they fell off the bone and were so tasty and tender...this is our new short rib recipe from now on....
89831,32147,2005-01-09,5,"MizzNezz, I made beef roasts using your wonderful sauce recipe tonight, it was just to die for, the roasts were just absoutely so juicy and had so much flavor. I browned the roasts first, and I doubled the sauce recipe and cooked the roasts in the oven on a very slow heat 300 degrees F, I actually made two roasts in the same roaster, as I will slice one up for roast beef sandwiches, DH said it was one of his best meals, I made homemade french fries and veggies to serve along the side, what a wonderful dinner! Thanks so much for posting another winner, I will try your recipe with short ribs next! Thanks, Kitten:)"
140132,32147,2008-01-06,5,I love short ribs and this recipe was great.  The ribs were tender and flavorful.  I served these with mashed potatoes and a vegetable.  Deeeeeelish.  Thank you for a keeper recipe to put in my comfort foods cookbook.  Stephanie
53932,32147,2008-12-06,5,"Other than being a little too sweet for this non sweet tooth, these were excellent."
126440,486261,2012-09-10,5,"Great Stack-Up.  Very easy to do, great flavors and very Filling meal."
171790,486261,2012-09-19,5,Soooo good! I left out the cilantro but otherwise made as directed. DH is disappointed that I'm holding off on serving up the leftovers tonight.
461834,486261,2012-10-10,5,"Delicious stack ups!!!  I made this as written although scaled back to serve one for my lunch the other day.  I get ground beef on sale and then take 2 lbs  home and cook it with a large diced onion, then I make several smaller freezer bags full of the mixture to use later in recipes such as this recipe.  The only change I made was to use dark red kidney beans in place of the black as I had some that were leftover and frozen from a previous Taco Salad.  This is pure Tex/Mex heaven on a plate!!!  It is very filling, next time I might just use two tortillas!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Holiday Tag Game."
140132,486261,2012-10-27,5,"Made these last night for son and hubby!  They are so good, but very filling.  I knew we would have leftovers, but we had more then I thought.  Very good, filling meal thats a snap to prepare.  My guys agreed, the cream cheese in this is so good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us, that I will turn to in a pinch."
29196,68955,2003-08-31,0,It's definately balsamic vinegar that is used as Toshiko offered to send it to me from japan if I couldn't get it here.
80353,68955,2003-11-27,5,"I'm here to rave about this recipe too!  This is nearly always what I look for in a 5-star recipe - maximum flavour derived from minimum effort - and the effort for this recipe is practically nonexistent.  I skillet-toasted some sesame seeds and sprinkled these over the chicken pieces before serving.  Steamed rice and oven-roasted brussels sprouts were the yummy others.  One thing I might do next time though, if I have a bit more time, is to brown the chicken pieces first - just to get a bit more attractive colour."
95743,68955,2004-09-18,0,"I tried this using Splenda and chicken breasts.  I wanted plenty of sauce so I doubled that part of the recipe.  I only cooked the 1"" chicken cubes about 15 minutes until cooked through. I simmered and boiled the sauce down for over two hours and it never really got to the point of being sticky.  It would have, given enough time, but by then the sauce was so salty it was nearly inedible.  I don't recommend you do any of the things I tried."
179133,68955,2004-12-29,5,"This chicken is very good. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and after tasting the finished product, had to add salt. I used a serrano chile, split, and left the seeds in - it could have used another for my taste (I like my food *spicy*). I removed the chicken after the 20 minutes (it was cooked through) and it took another 45 minutes or so to reduce the sauce to syrup consistency. I will make this again for sure!"
140132,68955,2006-12-15,4,"Simple , but tasted complex.  We love the balsamic vinegar, really makes this dish.  Thanks for an easy chicken dish.....Stephanie"
58104,68955,2006-12-21,5,Very flaverful! I cut the water back to 1/2 cup and used boneless chicken thighs.
286566,68955,2007-01-11,5,"Thank you to Tomoko and her mum.  I doubled the recipe and didn't quite leave a enough time for cooking (we ate a little late), served with rice and steamed vegetables, delicious.  They are even good the next day cold - good for a picnic."
158086,68955,2007-02-25,5,Add me to the list of lovers of this recipe....i used boneless chicken thighes and my company devoured all of it...
461834,68955,2007-04-17,5,"This is very similar to an appetizer recipe that I recieved from a friend for Japanese Chicken drumettes.  I loved the flavor of the chicken, but I think next time I would brown the chicken first.  This is such a simple and tasty dinner, thank you for posting!!!"
88099,68955,2007-09-02,5,"I have to add my 5 star here.  This was delicious.  Except for using a jalepeno pepper in place of the hot chili pepper, I made this as written and we loved it.  Plenty of wonderful flavored sauce to cover the chicken and rice that I served it on.  I can see that adding some vegetables to this would also work great.  Thanks for sharing. I'll be making this again."
4470,68955,2007-11-05,5,"What a wonderful sauce - loved the chicken!  I used skinless boneless thighs and I can only imagine how wonderful drumsticks with skin on would be.  The thighs came out moist and loaded with flavor.  Served over basmati rice, steamed fresh carrots & green beans.  Wonderful dinner thanks Jan"
400708,68955,2009-04-21,5,"With over 600 5 star reviews and 26 pictures; you sure don't need mine - but after making this I have to put in my two cents (or should I say stars) So easy and the taste is awesome, couldn't have a better combination.  I didn't change a thing, used chicken thighs (with skin as instructed) and it was great.  So differant from my normal chicken dinners and elegant too.  I could certainly use this even for those special company meals.  Thanks for posting and sharing this great recipe."
226863,68955,2009-05-02,5,"I used mainly boneless, skinless thighs, but through two drumsticks in with skin to help the flavor.  The sauce did take a while to cook down, but it is delicious.  I made this for All New Zaar Cookbook Tag game!  Thanks so much for posting a delicious recipe."
1072593,68955,2009-11-20,5,"A fine dining experience, but with me doing the dishes.  Made for Ed'n9 A/NZ Tag."
542159,68955,2011-07-10,4,"A nice easy chicken! This was met with mixed reviews DH loved it and I just found it to be ok, liked how nice the glaze turned out. Made as written using a jalapeno pepper and wished I had used a hotter pepper. Thanks so much for the post."
199848,68955,2012-11-18,5,"Awesome!  I used skin-on drumsticks just as directed.  Yes, you must be patient (its passive time anyway) to get that rich deep glaze.  I garnished the chicken with sliced scallions.  Definitely will make this again!  Thanx !"
428885,68955,2013-01-22,5,"Just finished making this. Boy, is it good, lip-smakin' in fact! After reading the reviews, I decided a couple of changes...I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs cut into pieces, and dredged in some cornstarch. (1 tablespoon = 2 thighs) I boiled down the sauce a bit before adding the chicken (approx. 15 minutes), and once I added chicken it cooked very quickly. (20 minutes). Other then that, I did everything else the same and it was Awesome with a capital ""A""."
204024,68955,2013-11-26,4,This made a good dinner for us tonight.   Some of us loved it and some thought that maybe there was a little too much vinegar.  Made for Name that Ingredient!
131126,35805,2004-03-24,5,This is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing! It was so easy and the results were wonderful. I will definitly make this again & again. I'm eager to try it now for calazones.
107135,35805,2005-03-05,5,wow everyone put this in your books this is an easy and great thick crust it melt in your mouth 
47892,35805,2005-07-28,5,"I put the ingredients into the bread machine as recommended by the manufacturer and the dough turned out perfectly. I chose to use a ratio of 1 cup whole wheat flour to 2 cups of regular flour to add a little more nutrtion. For the topping (I'm very picky about pizza topping)-first I bought fresh produce at the farmers' market for the best flavor. Started by whipping up a quick pesto-esque sauce with fresh basil, olive oil, almonds and roasted elephant garlic in the blender. Next I lightly sauteed brown mushrooms and baby spinach leaves in a little bit of olive oil. Set aside to cool. Then I spread the basil mixture onto the prepared dough. ( I used a large aluminum cookie sheet to bake the pizza. ) Next added some grated Greek myzithra and feta, some pecorino romano, the mushrooms and spinach,( I hate heavily laden pizza with 2 pounds of cheese) few slices of fresh toms, fresh oregano, black olives, then another sprinkle of cheese and finally a few shakes of black pepper.
Cooked for about 18 minutes @
425 degrees, turning the cookie sheet halfway through the baking time. The pizza crust was perfect, not soggy or dry or tough. Next time I'll add some anise and fennel to the dough for something different. Thank you for sharing your recipe. I was pleased with the results as was the hubby.  ;) cg

173579,35805,2006-01-08,5,This was a good crust.  I did have to add some water.  But it turned out really nice.  Thanks for posting.
88099,35805,2014-12-21,5,"Excellent pizza dough and so easy.  I have made this several times and it always turns out great.  I do cut back on the sugar to 2 tsp as a personal preference and on occasion I added some Italian seasoning for a change, but as written is just wonderful."
173579,42094,2007-04-21,5,This was outstanding!  What more can I say.  Will be using this from now on.  Thanks for posting.
101823,42094,2005-03-18,5,"I have prepared this sauce several times.  The first was as written, the second was with beef stock subbed for the water, and the third was with the additional liquid from recipe #59224 Chipotle Roast subbed for the water.  All were great, but the third method was outstanding.  This is such a simple method that produces an excellent enchilada sauce.  We love it.  Thanks."
176615,42094,2005-04-24,5,"Wonderful! Make this once, and you'll never buy the swill in a can again. Very quick, made from ingredients on hand and no MSG. I made as directed, letting simmer until fairly thick. Made for some killer enchiladas. Thanks, Mark, for a great recipe!"
160974,42094,2005-10-19,5,"This came in handy this morning, since I wanted a sauce to top my Double Corn Tortilla recipe. I didn't have regular chile powder, so I used 1 tsp. adobe powder and 3 tsps. taco seasoning (didn't want it too spicy). 

Roxygirl"
37449,42094,2006-02-26,5,"I used this recipe for jumping point. I started with salsa, because that's what I had. I then added all the seasonings and water. It cooked to a nice consistency and was great for a quick sauce. Thanks so much!"
126440,42094,2008-12-28,5,I made this to use in Recipe #33665.  It is very good and freezes well.  Good to have on hand for use in other recipes too.
498271,42094,2009-08-31,5,"Fantastic!  A thick, rich sauce, easy to make with ingredients I always have around and GREAT flavor.  I added about 1/4 tsp of cayenne as we like things a little spicy.  I used these on chicken enchiladas; we also dipped tortilla chips in the little bit that was left - yum!  Thanks for posting this great recipe!"
140132,42094,2011-06-25,5,What a great sauce this is.  I needed some for a last minute meal decision and didn't have a can so I chose your recipe and am so glad I did. It had great flavor and thickened up nicely unlike some other sauces I have tried to make and failed miserably at....lol.  DH said we should can this so we always have around.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us.
560491,42094,2012-08-08,5,This sauce is so much better than canned!  Used for recipe#224280 and it was a great addition.
41578,102617,2004-10-29,5,"This is a great coleslaw!  The celery seeds are a wonderful addition. We absolutely loved the dressing.  The combination of ingredients is the best of any creamy coleslaw dressing that I have ever tasted.   Perfect....wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Kittencal for another great recipe.
"
37449,102617,2005-04-19,5,"Yum! Very good recipe. I didn't have buttermilk, so used a tbls. of vinegar in whole milk. Worked like a charm! Thanks for a delicious cole slaw!"
88099,102617,2005-11-22,5,"Kitten this was one of the best coleslaw recipes I have ever made.  I used a bag of cabbage and carrots already prepared which cut down on time, but otherise made as directed.  There was a lot of the dressing, but used a slotted spoon to serve.  Great combination of flavors.  You do need to let it sit for the amount of time stated.  I really didn't think I was going to like this when I first made it.  But as the flavors blend, it become outstanding.  Thanks so much."
158086,102617,2007-09-24,5,"I was told to give this coleslaw 10 stars...I did not taste it as it went to the ""guys weekend together at the cottage""...but they raved about it, so it must have been great..."
140132,102617,2007-12-30,5,"perfection....as always, enjoyed this very much....thank you....Stephanie"
428885,102617,2008-04-11,5,"Beyond tasty Kitten and a thorough delight to fix for this afternoon at the farm. It is warmish here, even though the mid/west part of the U.S. has snow...however; we ambled on out in the bright sun, listen to the birds making nests, and had a burger accompanied by this delicious, cool, refreshing outrageously good coleslaw. I easily halved this recipe and made the dressing in the morning with ingredients I had on hand. I let that sit in the fridge for about an hour or so, and then thinly sliced the cabbage, (I also used red cabbage too) carrots, and in place of green onion, I had a red onion.  The buttermilk is such a great addition to this and I did use ""Hellman's"" mayonnaise. Had fresh lemon which I used the juice and some bright apples and spinach for extra pow. Thank you, Kittencal! Another winner!"
126440,102617,2009-01-19,5,"Delicious coleslaw.  I made half a recipe and made the sauce in the morning to refrig. then just before eating added the coleslaw mix, celery seed, and gr. onion.  Great served with Recipe #47391."
653438,102617,2010-03-17,5,WONDERFUL!!  I made this the other day to go with Recipe#18172#18172 for lunch (it hadn't chilled in the fridge for very long but oh it was good.  The next day we had it to go with Recipe#183526#183526 and ohhhhhh....so much tastier!! I made half a recipe and it made plenty.  I also used light cream in the sauce which made it nice and creamy.  This is a keeper and I'll go to this often.  Thank you again.
383346,78579,2008-01-20,5,I don't know why I have not try it earlier.  I should have :)  Cause it's wonderful.  It's so easy to remove when washing the dish.  Thanks Kit :)  Made for Zaar Star Game.
171790,78579,2008-02-12,5,I'm in love! Where have you been all my life. I'll be keeping some of this pan coating on hand from now on.
324390,78579,2008-02-19,5,I whipped this up using the end of my crisco and equal parts of the other ingredients. Put it all in a canning jar and now I have it on hand whenever I need it! I used it to coat some muffin pans to make some tarts and they all but slid right out! I'll be using this for now on!
136997,78579,2008-04-11,5,"I have nothing else to add to the many reviews, other than it simply works like charm. :)"
452940,78579,2008-08-26,5,"I tried this for Recipe #255053 and it worked wonderfully. For those (like us) who don't bake often, this recipe is easy to remember with equal portions of shortening/oil/flour, so a tsp or so of each ingredient does the job perfectly on an 'as needed' basis thereby eliminating the storage, thaw, and stir often issues to maintain consistancy when made in larger batches. Bakers Joy cooking spray, although more costly, is, for us, so perfect in application, stores easy, and no fuss. This recipe will serve as a great standby when we're out of the spray. And for this recipe, we definitely like using a paper towel vs. a pastry brush... less cleanup! Thank you hon, for a great standby recipe!"
226863,78579,2008-12-05,5,Works great!  Better than Pam or even crisco and flour!  I'll use this again.
428885,78579,2008-12-14,5,"How much easier and cost conscious could this be? I have been flying, I mean flying through cooking spray. I was perplexed by what ""they"" could be doing that was so increasingly $$ to make cooking spray so costly. I am so happy Kitten you made my life easier, wiser, and certainly a cost savings beyond belief. Man, everything in pantry, put together, poof, a good coating without the cost. Perfect! Thank you as always, dear Kitten. Made for you. Dec. 2008"
1072593,78579,2009-03-08,5,"Amen and hallelujah...I'm a believer! This release has the consistancy of a soft whipped frosting...looks like it, too. Very effective AND economical.--UPDATE--I've been waiting to use this on my most intricate bundt pan that almost never releases.  See Kay Demonbren's Recipe #97011 picture...perfection!"
280271,78579,2009-03-15,5,"Wow! This stuff works great. I'm so glad I came across it. Made it for ""best of 2008"" game. Thanks for posting. :)"
560491,78579,2009-12-22,5,This stuff is great!!!  I made it to use for my holiday baking; I make a lot of bar cookies and some are ooey gooey and stick in the pan.  This worked so well that they were coming out of the pan while I was trying to cut them!!  Will use as my new non-stick ingredient!
157425,78579,2009-12-29,5,"I always use Pam and it is getting a bit expensive and not really liking the aerosal can to much anymore. Gave this a try and love it! I used canola oil and Crisco with the flour and it worked great for us when baking for Christmas. Easy to put together and use, will even try this with cocoa powder for chocolate cakes like one reviewer mentioned. Thanks so much Kitten for posting this one! Made and reviewed for your Christmas Top 25 Recipe Tag."
400708,78579,2010-10-30,5,"I can't tell you how long ago I saved this with the intention of making it and just never seemed to get around to it.  What was I thinking!!!  Made it yesterday and it's a miracle - I love it and this will not disappear from my shelves again.  As a matter of fact, I'm making a second batch today for my DD's house.  I love the ""no chemical smell"" and it feels so much better and easy to prepare when mixed in my KA.  Thanks so much for posting."
126440,78579,2010-11-09,5,Made this and have been using it all summer and fall.  Great stuff.
47892,78579,2011-03-06,0,"Unfortunately I didn't care for this. It was the grainy consistency of the mixture<br/>that I was put off by. It's too difficult to explain really. So sorry just not a good recipe ""fit"" for me."
104295,55768,2005-07-25,5,This was excellent.  My first time trying brown basmati rice and the beans and corn were wonderful with it.  I used frozen corn instead of canned and used tomatoes fresh from the garden.  I also used banana pepper instead of jalapenos because I was serving it to children.  We had it as our main course and it was plenty filling.  I think this would be an excellent potluck dish for summer cookouts.  And I also ate some of the beans with homemade baked corn chips.  Very yummy!
95743,55768,2005-09-11,5,"Made the entire recipe as written, with fresh corn, and plan to use the leftovers on a Tex-Mex ""pizza"" tomorrow night.  Wouldn't change a thing."
222564,55768,2005-10-24,5,"Never mind the rice, the beans themselves with other ingredients made truly delicious salad!"
140132,55768,2008-02-21,4,This recipe was good.  We love black beans so this was a good recipe for us to try.  I will make this often this summer. Thank you for posting....Stephanie
126440,55768,2012-08-28,5,Great flavors in this dish.  I served it at room temp. and added a little cotija cheese.  Served with Recipe #21935.
8688,55768,2012-08-31,5,"This recipe is perfect!  It would be great served in soft tacos with a bit of guacamole as a meal.  I will make this recipe often, Barb!  Thank you!"
176615,55768,2014-02-20,5,"Yummy! Added a teaspoon of cumin, stirred it all together and served as a side dish with salsa lime chicken. Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
140132,107786,2008-06-22,5,So good.  I will repeat these often as my family devoured them as soon as they sat down.  I loved the flavor and was fairly easy to put together.  Thank you for posting.
1072593,107786,2009-08-22,5,"I used your recipe for recipe #288895 which adds a wonderful deminsion of flavoring. From the huffing and puffing exhibited from my husband, I do believe I've outshined him. As an olive branch, I offered him the recipe and the promise he can claim it his...poor baby."
386585,107786,2012-02-09,5,"Well, let me hop on the bandwagon and say I'm so glad you decided to share this wonderful recipe.  I made this exactly as posted (down to the Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce).  This really takes no time at all to prepare and then you just put it in the oven and forget about it.  They definitely come out better than when I cook them on the grill.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe that can be enjoyed year-round."
226863,107786,2012-07-01,5,"The seasonings are good, but I highly recommend finishing these on the grill instead of broiling.....much better taste that way.  Very tender and falling off the bone ribs!  Thanks!"
176615,52253,2006-02-19,5,"Very good! I've never made dumplings that were rolled before, and they were delicious and easy to do with the pizza cutter. I rolled out on a wax paper covered counter. Only changes I made were to use butter for margarine and 2 tablespoons chicken soup base for the bouillon cubes. I wouldn't cut down the amount of dumplings, but more chicken could be added if desired. Reheats beautifully. So comforting on a cold winter day! Thanks, Susie!"
173579,52253,2006-05-19,5,This was a very tasty meal. I had never use eggs in my dumplings but it made them so much better.  Will be using this from now on.  Thanks for posting.
527607,52253,2007-07-01,5,"just to add to my previous review, once i posted it a friends daughter came up for a bowl and she inhaled it.  LOL she did not even sit down to eat, she stood in the kitchen and ate so fast that she never got to the chair. i did change the broth a little by browning the chicken pieces and deglazing the pot with water and using the roast chicken seasoning that comes in a grinder spice jar instead of regular poultry seasoning. This gave extra flavor.  Some things i will try next time are making it a thicker stew,as well as using more onions and deglazing with white wine. Probably removing the dumplings after cooking to thicken/change the base and then readding them.  I think that they need the lighter broth to cook in. 

However just as it, its a flavorful deep chicken stock. Best way i can describe it is the perfect combination between homemade chicken soup and stew with dumplings."
88099,52253,2007-12-01,5,This was an exellent Chicken and Dumpling recipes.  Full of flavor and just what we were looking for.  The dumplings were excellent although next time I'll only make half because I couldn't fit them all into my largest pot.  This recipe is a little work but so worth the effort.  I've had this recipe saved in my cookbook for some time and am so glad I finally got around to making it.  Thanks Susie.  Just wonderful.
95743,52253,2008-01-15,5,Perfect dumpling ingredients no matter how you cook your chicken.
140132,52253,2008-01-23,5,Very good.  The flavor was very good.  I really liked the idea of adding the chicken broth into the dumplings.  And the whole dish was very comforting and warm on these cold nights....yummy. I will definately make this again.....Stephanie
452940,52253,2008-01-25,4,"Really Good! I will be making this again. I garnished it with fresh parsley right before serving. My MIL and GMIL said it was great, but to use buttermilk in lieu of some of the water, and to add some sage to the dumplings. I'll try it their way next time, but overall, a great dish! thanks susie"
400708,52253,2009-06-20,5,"With 182 reviews why add mine.  Because this is sooooo good I just cannot skip it.  Which I could give it 10 stars and it still won't be enough.  I've never made dumplings before but was always interested.  When a neighbor had surgery I thought this would be the perfect dinner to take to them.  I sure was right, I made it exactly as printed except cut the dumplings in half.  That was plenty for us, the only thing I think I did wrong was roll the dumplings to thick but the taste was still awesome.  Next time I'll know better, and there sure will be a next time.  DH AND the neighbor declared this the best chicken soup they'd ever had and the dumplings made it all that much better.  Thanks Susie for a recipe that is being moved to my favs."
8688,150863,2006-02-04,5,"Wonderful! Spicy and creamy, this makes a great winter's day meal served with some crispy bread and a tossed salad!  Thanks for sharing, Shawn : )"
199848,150863,2006-10-04,5,Fantastic soup!  Mashing some of the potatoes really gives it a nice texture.  The cream cheese adds a velvety texture.  I'll be making his again.  Thanx for sharing.
53932,150863,2006-12-02,4,"I liked this, but am not sure that I loved the cream cheese in the soup. I might substitute some cheese for a portion of the cream cheese next time.  I added some bacon for a little extra flavor."
169969,150863,2007-02-11,4,Pretty good potato soup. I thought it needed something to balance out the strong cream cheese flavor. I added bacon for a little more flavor. Thanks Chef.
400708,150863,2007-10-02,5,"Wonderful, warm, cozy soup for these cooler fall days.  So easy to make and good instructions.  I did add a 1tsp of minced garlic and 1 slice of bacon cooked and crumbled to this as a personal preferance and it was sooooo good.  Enjoyed by all, I've frozen the left overs and will have to see how that turns out.  Thanks Shawn for a recipe my whole family, including picky DGSs all enjoyed."
324390,150863,2007-12-25,5,"After the rush of last minute shopping, I decided to make this for a quick dinner. This was extremely quick to make, and we really enjoyed it with toasted cheese sandwiches. Thank you Shawn."
222564,150863,2009-02-14,4,"Lovely soup! I use bouillon cubes to make broth, all 4 for this one and it was mighty tasty. I actually skipped the seasoning salt or any kind of salt."
1179225,150863,2009-10-24,5,Delicious! We really liked this. I did add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of season salt and used low sodium broth. I I prepared the soup early in the day and then kept it warm in the crockpot until ready to serve. We topped ours with green onions and cheddar cheese. It couldn't have been any easier and tasted perfect on a cold fall night. Thanks for posting.
173579,150863,2009-10-28,5,This was very good and creamy soup.  This was even better the next day.  Thanks for posting.
107135,150863,2010-01-11,5,really good  soup. we put oysters in after a few meals and it made it all new soup . really good
140132,150863,2010-01-21,5,"I doubled this recipe and am so glad I did.  This is a fantastic potato soup recipe.  We added celery salt to the soup at the table.....mmmmmm.  Thank you so much for sharing, we loved it."
158086,150863,2010-04-07,5,This is really really good......I tripled the recipe...and addewd a tough of hevay whicpping cream and some cheddar cheese...used 1/3 less fat cream cheese....a great tasting fast soup.
166642,150863,2010-07-07,5,This is delicious soup. I made exactly as stated and it turned out perfectly. It is a bit spicy but good. Thanks for sharing!
80353,42780,2003-09-09,5,"This really was an excellent batter.  I made it up an hour before I used it as I have heard that this makes batter 'stick' better to whatever you're frying.  Anyway, it stuck.  Light, crisp and not greasy - exactly what I was looking for."
8688,42780,2004-06-23,5,"MG, this batter is excellent!  I fried up a batch of flounder that I bought today at Costco and it was just perfect!  I had a bottle of malt vinegar on hand, so Dan was in seventh heaven ; )  This batter reminds me of some tempura batter I made sometime ago.  Just the right consistancy to coat and perfect flavor for frying.  I will definitely make this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing, Mystergirl!!"
131126,42780,2005-09-28,5,Excellent and easy!  It really was very close to the batter at the restaurant. Thank you for posting this recipe.  
37449,42780,2005-10-26,5,"Delightful! Crispy and leight, this is a winner! I served with THE Tartar Sauce. Thank you Mysteragirl!"
324390,42780,2006-11-29,5,Light and crispy! I will never use a different batter to fry fish! We loved it!
140132,42780,2009-03-02,5,This was soooo good.  My kids will not eat fish except from LJS.  So I tried this and they devoured it.  Thank you so much for posting this great recipe.
222564,42780,2011-06-10,5,"Could be the best batter, ever!"
173579,42780,2011-11-08,5,Great recipe.  Thanks for posting.
179133,25730,2004-12-30,5,I found this recipe in the local paper months ago and then found it on here recently. I just made it and it is in the fridge for a New Year's party tomorrow. The only difference between the 2 recipes is the one I used called for plain pumpkin puree not the pre-seasoned pie filling. I added a sprinkle of allspice and cloves. It will be served with apple slices and gingersnaps. The newspaper also suggested serving with pear slices.
140132,25730,2008-06-22,4,"I made this for DH's weekly mens get together on ""dip"" night.  It was a hit and I was asked for the recipe the next day by a couple of the wives....lol.  I served this was cinnamon flavored graham crackers, gingersnaps and sliced apples.  Thank you for posting."
222564,25730,2009-12-24,5,I am joining the chorus of praisers of this recipe. FAB!
88099,9836,2006-02-23,5,"I put this together yesterday morning with frozen chicken and had my daughter turn it on before she went to work.  It cooked a little over 9 hours and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  Very moist and tender.  We served this over rice and all enjoyed.  I did use fresh minced garlic, but other than that didn't change a thing.  Thanks."
140132,9836,2007-01-30,5,"This is very good.  Easy too.  I didn't cook it is a crockpot as I left without starting it....lol.  So when i got home i cooked it on the stovetop.  I cubed the chicken and then browned it first. I served it on split biscuits for something different and it was fabulous.  I will make again in the crockpot as written but wanted to share my ""unplanned"" version too.  Thank you for a great meal....Stephanie"
157425,9836,2009-03-03,5,"This chicken was wonderful and the sauce was great over brown rice. I didnt have two cans of cream of chicken soup so I used one can of cream of celery. Added kosher salt, pepper, lemon pepper, and celery seeds than cooked on low for about 7 hous. Plated the brown rice than placed a chicken breast on top with some sauce over all that and served with green beans, fantastic supper for us! I will make this again and try the cream of broccoli soup like one reviewer did and serve with some steamed brocoli on the side. Thank you so much Kathleen for posting this recipe. Made and reviewed for the I Recommend Tag Game."
560491,9836,2009-09-01,5,"I thought this was very good.  Easy to make I put the chicken in frozen and cooked on low for 8 hours and the chicken was very tender, starting to shed when I stirred the mixture.  Served over macaroni noodles.  I made as directed so would have leftovers to freeze.  Will be a good crock pot meal to make this winter when it is cold and snowing out!!"
369715,9836,2012-05-17,4,"This was good and easy to make. I did change it up though. I made this in a pan on the grill. I used six boneless skinless chicken breasts, a can of cream of chicken, a can of cheddar cheese soup, garlic powder and pepper. I cooked these for 30 minutes. We all enjoyed this with the changes made."
95743,57130,2004-11-01,5,"This is definitely a man pleaser.  I made this with just 1 lb of chuck steak/roast using 1 can of soup, 3/4 can of water and 3T of onion soup mix.  Worked beautifully and was a much appreciated comfort food.  Great recipe, kc."
8688,57130,2006-02-09,5,"I have now discovered my new favorite crockpot pot roast!  The flavor of this roast is perfect.  Not too salty and not too bland ~ just right!  This makes the perfect gravy and you will not have to do a thing to it to serve.  I served this roast with mashed potatoes, peas, applesauce and crusty Italian rolls.  A perfectly comforting and very easy to prepare meal!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe which will be enjoyed in my house for a long while to come : )"
104295,57130,2006-07-04,5,"I made this up, at shapeweaver's suggestion, to take to some neighbors who are expecting a baby.  (I'm trying to stock their freezer a bit.)  I snuck a taste when I sliced it and packed it for freezing.  My roast was small (about 2.5 pounds) so I used 1 can soup, 5/8 cup water, and 1/2 pack of onion soup mix.  Great recipe.  Thanks."
173579,57130,2006-07-09,5,"Absolutely the best pot roast that my family has ever eaten.  So tender and moist.  The gravy was great also.  Will be making this many more times, I'm sure.  Thanks for posting such a fabulous recipe."
226863,57130,2008-09-13,5,"I found this recipe on allrecipes as well, and then found it in a ""Fix it and Forget It"" Cookbook.  It is a great pot roast.  I love it, and we all enjoy it every time I make it!  Thanks for posting!"
88099,57130,2008-03-16,5,This was just awesome.  My roast was so tender and juicy.  My mom used to make roast like this all the time.  The only changes I made was that I browned the roast really well before adding to my pot.  I used my LeCreuset dutch oven to cook it in instead of the crockpot.  Set the oven to 300 and baked it for 4 hours.  Added some potatoes and carrots after 1 hour of cooking.  Perfect for us.  Thanks
140132,57130,2009-08-06,5,"Great pot roast.   I made this last night for my family and it was tender and fall off the bone good.  I added some carrots for the last hour and boiled some potatoes on the stove.  I felt I needed to thicken the gravy a bit more so I poured into a saucepan and add a slurry....worked like a charm.  Very good flavor and so simple.  I will make again, I am about to sit down to a sandwich made with leftover roast, which btw....sliced very nice the next day.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us."
369715,57130,2010-11-03,4,This is good and very easy to make. I did omit the water since others stated the gravy was watery. We all enjoyed this.
400708,57130,2013-10-25,5,"This is so easy and sooooo good.  I looked for the golden mushroom soup but couldn&#039;t find it so just used the regular as the recipe stated and it was perfect.  The house smelled so good when my DGSs returned from school that the first thing they asked was &quot;when&#039;s dinner&quot; that&#039;s unusual for them.  I cut up potatoes, carrots, celery and onions and put on the bottom, browned the roast before putting in the pot and then let it go - the gravy, veggies and roast were done and ready at one time and tasted great.  This is my go to recipe from now on, so easy even the kids can make it themselves.  I have a photo but an issue with the site won&#039;t let me upload so will come back and do that once it&#039;s fixed."
8688,82925,2006-10-06,5,"I had two Granny Smith Apples to use so I thought I would try this recipe.  I am so glad I did because it not only is simple, but wonderful.  I used a loaf pan and sprinkled with the dry topping mix, then dropped butter slices directly onto the topping.  It worked wonderfully.  Very nice apple crumble.  Thanks, Steve!"
174096,82925,2006-12-06,5,This was an easy recipe to follow and it tasted great!  Thanks for sharing it!
140132,82925,2008-01-17,5,Delicious.  This is the perfect apple crisp.  The fruit held its shape wonderfully and the taste was delicious.  We served this was vanilla ice cream on top to let the ice cream melt down on the warm crisp...mmmmmm.  I will make this regularly since this make the perfect amount with just a little left over for me the next day...LOL.  Thank you for this wonderful dessert....Stephanie
173579,82925,2008-08-03,5,This turned out so moist and delicious.  My DS just raved over it.  Thanks for sharing.
428885,82925,2011-10-21,0,"Yum! Easy to put together, except for gathering the apples off the tree in the orchard. Fall is upon us, and love for all things apples are in the air.  <br/>I didn't change anything, except used some Pam in the bottom the second time I made it, becuase the apples stuck the first time. Added some caramel syrup on the vanilla ice cream which topped the apple mixture. Thanks for posting."
128473,82925,2011-11-21,5,"Thank you so much for sharing this easy to make dish 1Steve....delicious, absolutely delicious....I don't usually eat crisps, but your recipe has changed all that...my friend and I ate most of the crisp so I  had to make another for my dh....he loved it also.  Updated:  Six years, later and this is still my favorite apple crisp on the site. My dh would eat the whole dish by himself, if I let him. It is such a comforting dish, the spices are perfect in it."
400708,82925,2013-10-21,5,"Made this exactly as  posted including the English custard on top, very good - this is the first time I&#039;ve ever &quot;made&quot; a crumble but not the first I&#039;ve ever &quot;eaten&quot; one and with all the apples from the orchard decided it was time to make my own.  This was so good with the flavor of the tart apples and the crunchy topping, YUM; the only thing I had a problem with and I&#039;m pretty sure it was me - is that parts of the topping was still dry, thinking I should have added more butter to it or something.  But the flavors, oh my!!  Used recipe#483829 for the cream which was a new experience (in a good way) for me - thinking it&#039;d also be so good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream"
128473,46922,2004-03-28,5,"Wow...this was so good. My family ate the whole ham, in sandwiches in one sitting. Thank you Boopster very much. We will definitely have this again and again and again."
461834,46922,2007-04-09,5,"This recipe is worthy of it's title.  IT IS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  The ham was so tender, it almost melted in your mouth.  The flavor was excellent, not too sweet.  This ham was better than any other ham I have had, including Honey Baked or Heavenly Ham.  I used a 6 lb semi boneless ham, so I cut the brown sugar and mustard in half.  I cooked the ham for 3 1/4 hours and let it rest for 1 1/2 hours.  This will be the only ham I make at home, and no need to spend $60 for a honey baked ham.  Thank you so much for the recipe Boopster!!"
140132,46922,2007-08-15,5,I love love love this ham.  The flavor you get from the mustard and brown sugar is outstanding.  Yummy. We just finished our ham and I'm already thinking of making another...lol.  I will be using this recipe this coming Thanksgiving so i can wow my family.  thank you for this awesome recipe.....Stephanie
131126,46922,2009-02-03,5,"This truly is ""awesome"" and tastes sooooo good for so few ingredients.  The glaze is very thick & I spead it on the ham with my hands.  From looking at the photos I was almost expecting a yellow cast to the ham when finished, but it didn't have one.  The foil lined pan is essential!  This is sticky, sticky.  Next time I will  baste some of the glaze back onto the ham during cooking.  The bottom of the ham was well coated & dark, while the top & sides were flavorful, but could have had more of the awesome glaze IMO.  Thank you for sharing this recipe! =)"
482376,46922,2008-12-30,5,"This recipe made it into book#234156!WOW...WOW...WOW!!!!! I cannot say enough about how wonderful this ham recipe is. It is simply outstanding. By far, the best ham I have ever cooked. I used a 10 pound ham and used a cooking bag (following the package directions) instead of the foil. I cooked it for about 3 hours and it was done perfectly. I wondered how the combination of mustard (I used yellow) and brown sugar would be. It was FABULOUS!!! It imparts great flavor and is lovely to spoon over the sliced ham. This ham was so tender that it literally started to fall off the bone. FANTASTIC. Thank you!!"
1179225,46922,2009-10-04,5,Delish!!!!...and easy.
126440,46922,2011-01-09,5,Wonderful ham.  It was easy and had wonderful flavor.  DH loved it.  Served with Sweet Potato Souffle.
176615,46922,2012-04-24,5,Moist and very easy. Good basic ham. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
6357,76491,2005-01-20,5,"This is yummilicious! I can't believe how quick this got ready. I needed a few very good chocolate dessert recipes as I am off to a birthday party in a while, and I wanted to surprise the birthday girl{who turns 9 today} with a few chocolate homemade recipes. I picked this and I am so glad I did. This has come out superb! It tastes excellent and has a great texture. It was ready in 7 minutes!! I set this in a tray and then I used Smartie chocolates{colourful gems} to write ""ABI"" on place them on top of this pudding. So now, there is the birthday girl's name over her pudding! She's going to love this! Thank you so much for making me make this by posting it! 
"
67656,76491,2005-01-24,5,"I forgot how yummy real pudding could be.  This recipe easily adapts to the stovetop and takes just about the same time to prepare. 
Like others, I used Splenda and when making it again I will try it with a touch less to cut that chemically sweet taste.  I added a pinch of instant coffee for mocha pudding.  Next time, I'll try the peppermint.  Thanks for sharing."
176615,76491,2005-01-28,5,"Wonderful! I was looking for a quick dessert tonight and made this as directed except using 2% milk (I didn't have skim). It was thick after 4 minutes in the microwave. Very rich and chocolately. Really no more difficult than the stuff from the box but light years better and I would imagine cheaper as well. Thanks, Chris, for a super recipe!"
8688,76491,2005-02-07,5,"I have to admit, I am not one to actually cook with my microwave.  But this recipe is so simple, pudding so smooth, rich and chocolatey good, that there is no reason why I can't make this anytime I want! There's no reason not to have dessert ready all the time : ) I microwaved for the first 3 minutes, stirred and then microwaved an additional 4 with stirring in between, as suggested in the directions for the perfect consistancy. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us, Chris from Kansas!"
169969,76491,2005-08-09,5,This was so easy and so good! I cannot believe i have never made pudding from scratch before. I used the microwave and followed your directions and it came out perfect! The three year old of the house was in HEAVEN! Thank you for such a great recipe!
160974,76491,2005-10-31,5,"I used 2 percent milk and cooked on the stove. It took about five minutes to thicken. We had it for our Halloween dessert. I liked that it wasn't overly rich. Since it is made with ingredients that I always have on hand, I'll be making it often.

Roxygirl"
157425,76491,2005-11-16,5,I have made this pudding recipe quite a few times and I do not buy chocolate pudding in the box anymore. My dad is diabetic and wanted to make him a pie so used Splenda instead of sugar and I really could not tell a difference in taste. Very good pudding and dad enjoyed his pie!
383346,76491,2007-02-11,5,Delicious.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  It's easy to do.
104295,76491,2007-07-12,5,I'm number 96 and we loved this.  My husband was especially glad to see that there was a crust on the top (as I usually use the instant packages and they don't have one).  We found this ultra chocolatey and it was so easy to do.  Yum.
80353,76491,2008-02-24,5,"This is an excellent recipe - fast, easy and goes dwn delightfully.  My son asked for chocolate pudding last week and I chose this recipe because I wanted to try a microwave version.  I picked a winner and I have since made it another two times.  Thank you for a very good recipe."
140132,76491,2009-04-17,5,"This will curb any chocolate fix your having.  So yummy and easy and quick to prepare.  I will make this again and again and again, etc.  thank you so much for posting this super recipe."
1179225,76491,2009-10-10,5,This turned out great! what an easy way to satisfy a sweet tooth. Thank you for posting.
486725,76491,2010-09-14,5,"This is delicious and chocolatey, like a good hot chocolate. Very quick and easy. And I love that it's not too sweet. The first time I made this (in the microwave), I did encounter some lumps. I only needed 2 minutes in step 4 for an 1100 watt microwave. The second time I made this, I used the stove, and had no lump problems. I also decided to turn it into a mocha pudding - which was awesome! I added two tablespoons of instant coffee, plus one extra tablespoon of sugar."
95743,52488,2004-05-03,5,Add me to the list of this recipe's fans.  Absolutely wonderful.  Double the sauce and add some heat.  
222564,52488,2006-02-13,5,"Rave review number 120 for this recipe. Wow!
Absolutely divine flavor, easy, no fancy ingredients. I love sauces, so doubled it up. It still wasn't swimming in it, so might just triple it up next time, so good it was! "
169969,52488,2006-02-18,5,"Super recipe! So easy to put together! I used a combination of boneless thighs and breasts. The chicken does not need any extra sauce at all but, next time I will double the sauce so that there is some sauce for the broccoli. Wonderful recipe.... I knew 121 Reviewers couldn't be wrong! So here is another 5 star review for #122!"
280271,52488,2006-02-26,5,This is Great! Easy to prepare and had just the right flavor for general tso's chicken. I did triple the sauce to make sure I had enough for the rice. It was also great next day for leftover's at work. 
53932,52488,2006-03-05,5,This was just wonderful!  Better than the General Tso's at most Chinese restaurants.  I made the recipe just as written and it was perfect. 
140132,52488,2007-01-31,5,This is so very good.  I wasn't sure about the cornstarch breading but it was fantastic.  I made this with #38748 Chinese Fried Rice and it was a very satisfying meal for us.  Thank you for this great recipe......Stephanie
482376,52488,2007-06-09,5,"Outstanding!! I'd rate this higher if I could. It tasted exactly like General Tso's chicken at a Chinese restaurant. The sauce amount was perfect for us. I wouldn't change a thing. I recommend prepping everything before you set out to cook (make the sauce, mix the cornstarch & beaten eggs, cube the chicken, start the rice, etc...). I searched high and low for rice wine and finally found it at Kroger. I think this would be a great entertaining dish along with egg rolls, rice, steamed veggies, almond & fortune cookies! I'm anxious to try making it up through the stage 1 frying, refigerate & when guests come, do the second stage frying. 
Delish recipe...MUST TRY!"
452355,52488,2008-11-22,5,Loved it!  What can I say that hasnt already been said?  This dish is easy to prepare and has great flavor.  We chopped up one of the chili pods (used Thai dragon chilis) and left the other 4 intact to give the dish some heat.  I will definitely double the sauce next time.  Thanks for this keeper.
126440,52488,2008-12-17,5,This was a great recipe.  I used chicken breast but was delicious!  Served with Perfect rice  Recipe # 53520 and  Oven Roasted broccoli Recipe # 206184.  Great Meal!
226863,52488,2013-07-17,5,"This is definitely a good General Tso&#039;s recipe....not the best I&#039;ve found but very good.  I halved the amount of chicken but left the sauce amount alone.  I wanted some sauce for my steamed broccoli. I also increased the pepper to chicken amount, but I like things spicy.  Served over jasmine rice, and this was a very good dinner!! Thanks for sharing your adopted recipe."
136997,10744,2006-01-21,5,"Well, I don't know what else to add, It's a tasty as everyone has said. The only addition I made, was to include a bit of rubbed sage. Just a personal taste. I also used homemade stock and crust. Delicious! :) "
222564,10744,2006-12-14,5,"Scrumptious! May take a little time, maybe, but is not too complicated at all. Very good trouble - result ratio. I used 2 chicken bouillon cubes and no salt and skimmed milk for half'n'half. Very rich and creamy anyhow. Might try some herb for change, like a little thyme or rosemary, or Herb's de Provence that has both and more."
158086,10744,2007-10-15,5,Wow what a recipe...I did not even think I liked Pot pie....This is a real winner...I did change and instead of doing carrots I added a 10 oz pkg of frozen mixed veggies with the potatoes and celery....I will be making this for my sunday dinners for the family this winter for sure.
140132,10744,2008-01-01,5,First attempt at making a pot pie and it turned our wonderful.  We loved it.  I was leary about it being to runny when it was done but no such thing.  This was perfect and far better then those store bought ones.  Thank you for a new recipe that will be part of our main menus.....Stephanie
88099,10744,2008-10-31,4,Excellent.  Flavors went well.  Easy to make.  A lot of the juices spilled over while cooking.  I think next time I'll used a little bigger dish to cook it in.  I also put one of the pie crust on the bottom and cooked it for about 10 minutes before adding the filling.  Worked out well.  Thanks
1072593,10744,2009-02-03,5,"Vincy, honey, if you held this recipe ransom, I'd think we'd have some negotiating to do.  Like another chef said, it's the potatoes that makes the difference.  Home cooking at it's best from over 300 test kitchens!"
126440,10744,2009-03-26,5,Excellent chicken pot pie.  I love the sauce.  I thought it was easy and has great flavor. I did add a few fresh mushrooms when cooking the veggies maybe next time I'll try broccoli.
369715,10744,2013-11-25,4,I used a can of mixed vegetables instead of the vegetables called for in the recipe. I also added a teaspoon of pepper. We all enjoyed this but thought the gravy could have had a tad more seasoning in it.
37449,54257,2005-02-20,5,"This made a very nice tasting meatloaf. I used a tad too much milk(didn't read the review), but the taste was excellent. Thanks Nita!"
173579,54257,2006-08-31,5,This was fantastic!  One of the best meatloaves that I have ever had.  I did only add 1/4 cup of the milk.  It baked up nice.  Will make this many more times I'm sure.  Thanks for posting.
89831,54257,2006-10-28,2,"Sorry for the low review I really wanted to like this recipe, based on all the 5 star reviews I really cannot understand what all the hype is about this recipe! it is totally lacking in flavor and in texture, the sauce on top is like eating jelly or jam, even with added fresh garlic this recipe was a total dissapointment for my family and ended up by tossing it away after having only a few bites. I think will stick to my own recipe, oh well we all have different tastes, but thank you anyway...Kittencal"
323186,54257,2007-03-19,5,"Every time I make this, it just gets better!!   had it last night with mashed potatoes (mashed with cream, cheese and garlic), buttered green beans and carrots with creme fraiche...umm  yes, not a calorie-counting night!!!    Children,  as usual, have  meat loaf sandwiches today.....thats half the excitement of the meal, knowing what they will get the next day, I have to make sure I make enough to HAVE left-overs!!   I am giving this recipe to a dear friend, aged 70,  who doesnt make meatloaf because she has never found a good recipe......I told her,  this is the recipe!!    In exchange I'll be getting her HealthBread recipe!  Yum!  Even tho she is 70 she has a husband and sons for whom she still cooks,  but she cant stand for too long,  I told her this is quickly put-together and then looks after itself,  excellent."
140132,54257,2007-04-04,5,I have made this a couple of times already and each time it turns out wonderful.  I am one who cannot make a meatloaf that can be sliced????  But with this recipe it was perfect.  Thank you for a great tasting meatloaf that doesn't crumble under my knife...lol.  The flavor was exactly what we look for in a meat loaf.
383346,54257,2007-07-02,5,I used 2 lbs of ground beef and regular milk (1/2 cup).  I had to cook it for about 1 hour and 30 minutes cause I wasn't sure it was cooked through.  It's delicious.  Thanks :)
158086,54257,2007-07-12,5,This was a big hit at my house....It was wolfed down so I know it is a keeper....hardly any left for sandwiches the next day...
126440,54257,2008-12-13,5,"Not that you need another rating, but this is a great recipe.  I have made it a couple times and it is very easy.  Love the sauce! Served it with baked potatoes and roasted green beans."
56003,54257,2010-01-16,4,"What a good meatloaf..... I, too, thought the mixture would be a little too wet, but let it sit for about 15 minutes, and it was fine. The guys thought the sauce was â€œda bombâ€�. Way different than my own meatloaf, but thought it was getting a little â€œoldâ€�......so glad I chose this for a change. Thnx for posting your recipe, Nita."
104295,54257,2010-02-06,5,"Being review 674, there isn't a lot left to say.  But my kids loved this and said it was the best they had ever had.  I used low fat turkey and 3 tbsp. of brown sugar.  A good comfort meal alongside scalloped potatoes and green beans, with the snow falling down outside."
166642,54257,2010-03-04,5,"Awesome meatloaf! This is going in my tried and true recipe cookbook. The sauce is just outstanding and the meatloaf is moist. I made as follows except I used dried breadcrumbs. I used the 1/2 cup milk. For the sauce, I only used 2 T apple cider vinegar. Worked perfectly. Thanks for sharing!"
169969,54257,2011-01-13,0,"This is a great meatloaf recipe. Our entire family loved it! I was surprised at the amount of liquid that I poured out of the pan after it cooked. The meat seemed a little mushy from the 1/2 cup of half and half, but the meat had plenty of texture after it cooked and I am glad I did not add more meat to the mixture. I cooked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes and it sat on the stovetop for about 15 minutes before I sliced it. Had to be a bit careful slicing, but did get nice slices. The leftovers made awesome meatloaf sandwiches! Update: Doubled the recipe tonight and it was still wonderful! 1/13/11 Made a double batch again today! So yummy!"
400708,54257,2011-06-30,5,"Review #848, so why bother - because after reading all the reviews I HAD to try this for myself and I must say all the reviews are well earned.  Yes Virginia, this is truly one this is truly one great meatloaf!  I made a few minor changes but I think it only added to the taste.  Took another reviewers advise and carmilized the onions (adding celery and garlic to them) prior to adding to the mix, added 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke as we love that smoky flavor and 1 tablespoon of worchester sauce for flavor.  Added another 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the sauce and then baked as directed in one of those special meatloaf pans that has 2 layers and drains off the grease.  The end result was a lovely meatloaf that was firm when cutting and tasted awesome, took your advise and made extra sauce to use for dipping on the side.  YUM!!  Served with homemade potatoe chips and sesame spinach with a glass of Washington's fine red wine.  Lovely."
428885,54257,2011-12-09,5,"Yep, this is lip-smakin' good. Didn't change one thing, used cream - if you're gonna enjoy meatloaf, then e n j o y meatloaf. There's no cryin' in good meatloaf. Go ahead. This is the real deal."
133174,54257,2012-10-28,5,"Let me add my rating to the 942 already present.  Hard to believe that I haven't tried this before now.  This is a very basic meatloaf that reminds me much of what my mother made when I was little.  As one reviewer suggested I will be making this again as using mini-loaf pans.  This made a wonderful meal served with sauteed yellow squash, Recipe #119430 and cornbread muffins."
204024,54257,2013-01-16,4,Good but the sauce is too vinegary for us.  Made for I recommend.
560491,54257,2013-05-29,4,"This is a good meatloaf recipe, I just do not think it is the best I have had.  I liked the sweet-tangy sauce on top, it is a nice change from just ketchup, but the meatloaf itself needed more flavor.  Made for Name That Ingredient Tag."
173579,136589,2007-03-27,5,This was very good but very rich.  Will be making this again I'm sure.  Thanks for posting.
158086,136589,2007-10-09,5,"What a fabulous recipe this is!  I made it with splenda for baking and splenda blend brown sugar to cut down on the sugar content, and it turned out great...sure is yummy when it is still warm from the oven!"
8688,136589,2007-10-17,5,"I followed Rose of Sharon's simple instructions to the letter for wonderfully delicious results!  I did however poke several holes with a wooden skewer so the sauce could seep into the cake.  I have used this method on other cakes and it provides a really nice moist texture with the flavor evenly distributed throughout the cake.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, Rose of Sharon!"
222564,136589,2008-01-03,5,"Loved it, moist and very appley and caramelly."
324390,136589,2010-02-07,5,Great cake that is perfect for breakfast or a snack. We enjoyed it with coffee.
140132,136589,2008-02-22,5,We loved the cake.  It reminded me of the cake my g'ma used to make.  DH loved the sauce I drizzled over.  Thank you for an old fashioned recipe from my childhood.    Stephanie
226863,136589,2010-02-28,5,"Very moist cake.  I substituted pecans, because that is what I had on hand.  I also used half applesauce and half oil.  LOVED the glaze.  Like other reviewers, I think it would be great over ice cream!"
95743,222188,2008-04-14,0,"I don't believe I've ever had buttercream frosting.  It's not the type of thing I would normally eat for the last several years and my  memory of childhood frosting used Crisco, something I wouldn't even consider now in this quantity.  It took a bit of getting used to but after some adjustments and a spatulaful or two, the butter version grew on me. ; )   I turned half the batch into chocolate by adding 1/2 cup cocoa.  I liked that best, being a chocoholic.  I think cream cheese is my frosting of choice but this is a perfectly acceptable substitute for butter fans."
104295,222188,2008-07-04,5,"Very good buttercream!  My cousin is a pastry chef and hers is the best ever, but mine was pretty darn good!  I used it to decorate some 4th of July cupcakes and they held the sprinkles well.  Thanks."
452940,222188,2009-07-20,5,"This is a great buttercream frosting recipe. Had no problems with it at all. I made blue ones and put sprinkles all over them to celebrate our zaar friend, Chef #936601, giving birth to twins tomorrow. Rock on Debi and Tim! Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)"
140132,222188,2011-02-09,5,Perfect frosting.  I used this on some cupcakes last night and it was the perfect consistency.  Thank you for sharing.
173579,222188,2013-02-04,5,Very nice frosting.  I had rave reviews from my family.  Thanks for posting.
1179225,222188,2014-05-18,5,"Perfect butter cream icing! It spreads beautifully, would change a thing. Thanks for sharing the keeper recipe."
158086,17126,2007-09-26,5,"I added green pepper and onion, and put cheese on top to melt just before serving...great stuff..."
140132,17126,2008-01-16,5,"Easy, tasty.  We loved it. I will make again.....Thank you very much....Stephanie"
53932,17126,2010-01-10,5,Excellent! Perfectly seasoned.
452355,17126,2012-02-26,4,Very easy to make.  Was in a hurry to find something that required little chopping to go along with my chiles rellenos.  It did need a little more seasoning and was a tad bit dry.  The chopped green onions and cheese (we used monterey jack) definitely improved the flavor.  Thanks!
37449,17126,2013-11-01,5,Yum! I used diced tomatoes with mild chiles and fresh oregano from the garden. Thanks!
8688,52892,2004-06-09,5,"Enjoyed this Alfredo sauce! I used half and half and the cream cheese.  I served over a thin spaghetti, used Bethany's Shrimp recipe #47515 to top it off and served with a tossed green salad and crispy Italian rolls for a great supper!  Thanks for sharing!"
369715,52892,2008-11-04,4,Good and easy to make. I followed this exactly as written. I wasn't sure that is was going to thicken up but it finally did. I served it over cod. We all enjoyed it.
140132,52892,2013-04-02,5,Very creamy and delicious.  I served this with grilled chicken and a salad.  Thank you for this easy sauce recipe.
126440,52892,2015-02-02,5,Nice sauce.  Made half a recipe to use in Recipe #154640.  Still have some left so will serve with pasta.
89831,50719,2004-06-30,5,"Well,what more can I add that already hasn't been said...these were just amazing muffins. I made mine in jumbo muffin tins, and added 1 tsp of pure almond extract instead of vanilla, I think the almond goes better with blueberries than vanilla...I made them with half and half cream instead of milk, and used frozen (semi-thawed) blueberries, I let them thaw a bit so the muffins would have a nice blueberry streak in the middle. These muffins had a wonderful texture and taste, I will be definately be making them again, thanks so much for sharing....Kittencal:)"
126440,50719,2004-08-13,0,These muffins are awesome.  Very easy to make and delicious.  
8688,50719,2005-01-14,5,"This is an excellent recipe for blueberry muffins!  More of a cake-like consistancy than your usual muffin. Next time I prepare, I will remember to double the toppings! I will definitely make again!  Loved it.  Thanks so much, KRUSTY!

"
176615,50719,2013-06-29,5,Very good! Tons of blueberries. I used frozen wild berries and topped with natural sugar rather than the nutmeg mixture. Made 18 regular-sized muffins. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
8688,16531,2002-07-14,5,"Mirj, I made this tonight for supper and we had such a marvelous meal! I made it exactly as directed and  it was done in about 6 hours.  I think the rice with the juices maybe every bit as tasty as the chicken!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!  DH says this is a keeper!"
41578,16531,2002-11-20,5,"I have made these twice now.  I also use boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  My crockpot cooked them to ""perfection"" in just a little over 4 hours. I used apple vinegar and Sprite, however I used 1/2 teaspoon of regular black pepper AND 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and it was just right for us.  The second time I made them and after they cooled down, I cubed the chicken in bite-size pieces and added them to a meat/cheese platter that I had already prepared for an appetizer party I attended.  The crowd went wild and asked for the recipe. The next time I make the platter, I will definitely cut back on the trail balogna, pepperoni, etc that I normally put on it and add MORE of this fabulous chicken.  It really added a nice zip to a normally boring platter.  Mirj, I am so glad I found this recipe.  Thank you so much.  :-)"
140132,16531,2007-08-15,4,"this was a nice surprise to me.  I wasn't sure about the sweetness but it was very good.  I served this with white rice and veggies.  Very nice meal, thank you.....Stephanie"
560491,16531,2007-10-29,3,"This was good, but I think I could have let it cook longer or cut the chichen breasts up more, they didn't have a lot of flavor in te middle.  Also next time I think I will use Cider Vinegar rather than white."
160974,16531,2008-01-02,5,"This turned out even better than I hoped! I cooked on low for about 2 hours, since I only used about 4 fairly thin boneless chicken that I cut into large chunks. I used a scant 3/4 cup brown sugar and about 1/3 cup cider vinegar and it was perfect. The black pepper really makes this flavor combination stand out. It reminded me of Bourbon Chicken at the mall. Thanks Mirj, for posting.

Roxygirl"
199848,16531,2009-03-28,5,"Very nice blend of flavors.  It was sweet and tangy.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and they were fall-apart tender.   Thanx for sharing; I'll make this again.... maybe even with pork."
126440,67256,2004-06-03,4,Made this yesterday and it was very good.  We had it for dessert last night and then a very small piece with lunch today. I had to cook mine 1 hour 20 min. before it was done.  I did put it into the freezer as stated. I made half a recipe of the frosting and I could have used a little more.  But was delicious.  Good use of frozen bananas.
173579,67256,2004-11-19,5,I have been looking for the perfect banana cake.  This is it.  It is fabulous.  Keeps for a long time.
136997,67256,2007-03-12,5,"What an awesome cake! I was a wee bit sceptical about the oven temp. but it worked. I did have to bake it 1 hr. 30 min though. I tortured my husband by making him wait until the next day to add the frosting, since it had to cool overnight as I hadn't made it until late in the day. So worth the wait he said. :)"
461834,67256,2007-09-01,5,This is a very moist and delicious cake.  I cooked mine at 300 degree oven and it took 1 hour and 20 minutes and then went into freezer for the 20 minutes.  It took 5 medium sized bananas to get the 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas.  I think putting the cake immediately into the freezer is the trick to such a moist cake.  Thanks for a great recipe Rhonda*J*!!
140132,67256,2008-01-25,5,Oh man was this good.  So moist and flavorful.  I love banana cake and this has to be the best I've had.  This cake didn't last long at our house...lol.  Thank you for this delicious cake recipe....Stephanie
428885,67256,2008-11-15,5,"You could smell the aroma of banana cake all the way out the front door and down the spring pump house in the field. Everyone quickened their step as to see who would make it first to get a slice of the beaut of a cake. I followed this exactly, however, did use 2 9"" cake pans. I cooked for exactly 1hour 10 minutes, took em' out and popped them in the freezer (much to the dismay of our guests - who- thought they could have a piece right away - NOT :)  ) Iced them up, added some grated orange peel and a couple of mini-chocolate chips (used for another cake) and proceeded to have my guests wolf this down like fresh grain being fed to calves the first time. Wonderful! Thanks for posting this gem! Fall 2008"
1179225,67256,2009-08-31,5,"This cake is delicious! I did put in the freezer after baking. I thought I might skip this step next time, but the more I thought about, why mess with perfection. Will be making this cake again very soon. Thank you for posting!"
158086,67256,2010-01-22,5,"This recipe probably does not need another 5 stars, but it is worth every one of them....The cake was wonderful, I even used splenda for baking to cut down the sugar and it rose and tasted fabulous...."
486725,67256,2010-06-19,4,"This is indeed really good. I bake a lot of cakes and quick breads, and would say that this is between the two. It was done at one hour for me. I wasn't sure about bringing my freezer temperature down, but did follow the directions. Someone mentioned still having to cool it after 45 minutes in the freezer - mine was very cool after/the pan was frozen. I always decrease the sugar in recipes. Since many people halved the sugar in both the cake and the frosting, I quartered both of them - and it was still sweet enough for us. The walnuts are a very nice addition to this."
204024,67256,2013-05-08,5,"Moist and Delicious, cream cheese frosting is terrific per DH.  We didn&#039;t use the freezer method and it turned out great.  I also put my oven on 350 and it also turned out fine.  Made for Name that Ingredient Tag."
160974,5170,2005-09-11,5,"Nice pancake to start the kids off on their first week of school. I served mine with fresh strawberries and syrup. Congratulations on being on the Top 40 List.

Roxygirl"
461834,5170,2007-03-18,5,Excellent pancakes.  I cut the recipe in half as there were only two of us eating today.
140132,5170,2007-11-03,4,I made these for breakfast the other day. Very simple and very good.  We really enjoyed them....thank you....Stephanie
176615,5170,2009-02-22,5,Absolutely wonderful! Fluffy and light. Served with maple syrup and recipe #42038. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
1179225,5170,2009-11-17,5,Just right! Thank you.
560491,5170,2010-08-27,5,"Made these for our weekly 'breakfast for dinner' and they were excellent!!  I prefer thin pancakes to thick ones, however these were so light and fluffy they have become my new favorite!!  Will be making these in the future rather than buying mix!  Made for I Recommend Tag."
383346,5170,2010-09-21,5,This is a great recipe for pancakes.  I love thick pancakes and these are perfect.  I just omitted the salt.  Thanks Bill :)  Made for I recommend tag game
286566,5170,2010-11-09,5,I made a half recipe for the DM and I as an afternoon snack with some fresh fruit and recipe #378378 which made for a delightful afternoon tea.  Thank you Bill Hilbrich and Boomette for recommending in I Recommend Tag game.
498271,5170,2011-02-08,5,This is a terrific pancake recipe!  It's hard to imagine how such big and hearty pancakes can also taste so light and fluffy.  I'll be using this recipe for pancakes from now on ....thanks for sharing it!  Made for the Best of 2020 Event (recommended by AZPARZYCH)
369715,5170,2012-11-03,5,This was my first time making pancakes from scratch. Wow these were so good. My husband ate five pancakes and said he could have ate eight of them.I followed the recipe exactly as written. I will make these more often with my families approval LOL
104295,25885,2003-09-26,5,"This had wonderful flavor!  I had defrosted all my frozen bananas and found that I had so many I needed something that took a ton of them.  I hypothesized that with this many bananas I wouldn't need all the fat and I was correct.  I used half the fat, and since I was almost out of butter I used oil.  A fabulous flavor and the kids love it!"
8688,25885,2004-04-11,5,"An absolutely delicious banana bread with all that is promised!  I used 4 very large, overly ripe bananas which did not prove to be 2 1/3 cups, so I added just enough sour cream to make up the difference.  I also added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans to the mix. The end result was fabulous!  I knew with all these reviews, I couldn't go wrong ; )  Thanks for the lovely banana bread, Shelley~by the sea!"
128473,25885,2004-09-13,5,"Thank you so much Shelley-By-The Sea for sharing this amazing recipe. We all really enjoyed this moist and tender treat.The overall flavour was intense but not over powering. I will definitely be making this again,its a keeper. I didn't even have to use my MIL's secret for making moist banana bread. (you wrap the warm bread in tinfoil as soon as it comes out of the oven to keep it moist) Your bread was moist all on its own. Kudo's.... BK"
176615,25885,2004-12-26,5,"Beautiful, moist banana bread with loads of banana flavor and a crisp crust. I really prefer the flavor of butter and brown sugar to regular banana bread with oil and white sugar. Used 5 medium bananas and baked for 85 minutes and it was perfect. Thanks, Shelley by the sea, we'll be having this often!"
222564,25885,2006-04-25,5,"All 190 viewers can't be ignored and I too tried this banana bread. The flavor was truly banana and bread wonderfully moist, both due to high banana content. Very basic recipe but good, everyone can add their own bits and pieces to this. I made muffins and iced them with Lynnie the K's Greatest Choklate Icing. Yum!"
89831,25885,2006-09-20,3,"This was just okay but nothing over the top special, definately needs more sugar and probably needs some baking powder, it did not rise as much as I expected and was on the heavy side. I might give it a try again with added baking powder and more sugar, when I do I will edit this review. thanks anyway!...Kittencal:)"
140132,25885,2007-01-30,5,"Wow....this was so moist and flavorful that I couldn't stop nibbling.  I doubled the batch and it was gone by nightfall.  If you like bananas, you will love this recipe.  Thank you for such a great bread recipe.....Stephanie"
383346,25885,2010-12-02,5,This is a great bread.  I used margarine instead of butter.  I added 20 minutes to the cooking time.  Thanks Shelley :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
133174,25885,2011-06-07,5,This was made as  per recipe.  With all the bananass the bread was super mosit and even right out of the oven the bread was very flavorful.  I did add in some chopped pecans.  Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe.
482376,25885,2012-09-23,4,"Very good banana bread. The banana is definitely the star here, as it should be! I loved that it was so easy to put together. I checked mine after 55 minutes and it was just staring to get too well done. It probably could have been pulled out after 50 minutes. Thanks for posting this yummy, easy recipe! Made for the I Recommend Tag in the Cooking Tag Games forums."
1179225,25885,2017-10-31,5,Perfect! I had to bake mine an additional 15 mins.
5060,26257,2002-08-20,5,"WOW!!!  Like everyone says, this was incredable, what a success!! Everyone that came now has the recipe. Followed everything exactly, but had to use regular brown sugar in the rub, it was wonderful anyway! In the fantastic sauce I had to use onions instead of shallots, couldn't get any decent shallots. It took about 8 1/2 hours and came apart so easily. As everyone in the thread said to use CWB, we found the cheepest possible and still can't figure why cheap white buns?? Although admittedly, they were perfect, don't know why! I made 3 different sauces, to see which we liked best and without doubt, your molasses bbq sauce was outstanding! (a bit sweet for me, but I was outnumbered!)Thanks Mean Chef for turning my thoughts about pulled pork around, dry heat is definately it and the rub is still tingling.  The flavours were fantastic! There was some meat left over so I did it up in wraps and froze them, looking forward to some great lunches!"
8688,26257,2004-05-06,5,"I've been making pulled pork for many years and this one is a winner! The flavor of the rub is an excellent compliment to any sauce you may use.  I know because I made three additional sauces to try with this pork.  The molasses sauce recipe given with this recipe is excellent.  I prepared this recipe exactly as directed with no modifications. Thanks for sharing this one with us, Mean Chef : )"
95743,26257,2004-03-06,5,Divine made with a 6 pound pork shoulder and half the rub recipe.  Next time I'll make double the perfect molasses bbq sauce.  Took the recommended 8 hours at 250° and the house smelled like the world's best cook lives there.  Thanks.
4470,26257,2004-04-09,5,"I finally got around to making this wonderful ""Pulled Pork"".Because I used  a 3 1/2 lb boneless leg roast  I watched it like a hawk as it turned quite dark - it was ready after 6 hours-pulled apart and was still moist. The problem was that as I was pulling it apart I couldn't resist nibbling on the dark outside crust, great flavor from the rub! The rub is wonderful and I am going to try it on chicken.  I used nearly the whole recipe on this smaller roast then really rubbed it in - I believe it helps to seal the juices in to keep the meat moist.  I also made the Molasses BBQ Sauce - I really did not enjoy the aroma while it was simmering but the end product was perfect with the pork.  I served the pulled pork on a mini Ciabatta bread with oven fries and cut up tomato. FABULOUS  Thanks Meanie "
133174,26257,2004-08-24,5,"I have looked at this often and I knew it would be good.  It was wonderful!  I followed the directions to the letter, which is something hard for me, cooked it overnight in my roaster oven at 200 degrees.  The meat is juicy and falling apart tender.  I made burritos with the meat this morning and tonight... We have some good eating ahead of us.  Easy to understand why this recipe has so many wonderful reviews!"
101823,26257,2004-11-14,5,"As the other 100+ reviewers have stated, this is an excellent recipe.  I followed the rub instructions exactly, and the house smelled wonderful as the butt slowly roasted in my oven for 8 hours.  I didn't realize that I was out of cider vinegar until it was too late, and therefore made a different sauce (instead of the one recommended in the recipe or the Pig Pickin Sauce).  Our sandwiches were great.  It will be nice to have the leftovers for easy meals later this week."
53932,26257,2005-04-10,5,"Wow!  This was so good! I cooked a 7lb butt for 8 hours and it was perfectly done.  I used brown sugar in the rub, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I make this, I'll try smoking it.
The molasses sauce was a tad sweet for me (but then I'm not a fan of sweets anyway), but still very tasty.  Thank you for sharing this!!!!"
173579,26257,2005-12-06,5,Very good recipe.  We all liked it very much.  Thanks for posting.  
169969,26257,2005-12-11,5,Wonderful! The only mistake was that I made 1/2 a butt instead of a whole...or even 2 for that matter!!! This recipe is so delicious and beautiful when it comes out of the oven! I only let the butt sit out at room temperature for an hour. I figured that half a butt would take less time - if you are also blond and thinking along these lines.... stop now... it still takes the full 7-8 hours. I like the sauce that is included in the recipe as well.... sweet....but not too sweet! This really is an outstanding recipe and is worth every star it has earned as a whole. Thanks for posting! 
222564,26257,2007-04-02,5,"Oh yeah! That was good! Picky DH couldn't find enough words to praise this and is willing to have it anytime, anywhere....
The dry rub is incredibly good. I was trying to figure wheather to leave the skin and fat on or not, since it was baked dry. Decided to leave it on. The bits not covered with skin became wonderfully crispy and tasty, but not dry in the least bit. The bits covered with skin where fattier, of course, but not as tasty. We really liked the crispy bits and I might skin the butt next time, just leave little fat on top. My ""butt"" was 6 lb, as I suppose they usually are. Great recipe, also the sauce was top notch!!!"
160974,26257,2007-05-27,5,"I made this for company last night. I was REAL nervous about the cooking time, after reading ALL the reviews (they varied completely on times). I cooked mine (two 3 1/2 pounds) on convection 225-275 and 300 the last half hour (!)and it took about 7 hours til the meat was roughly 195 degrees. My exterior was so dark looking that I was worried it was charred but it was perfect and the meat, totally moist! My guests really liked it and it was a fun entree for kids and adults. I did not like the barbecue sauce, though, and drizzled a bit on the meat but stopped. The chicken stock and wine combined to an odd muddied flavor. I let my guest sample (to decide whether to use it) and he didn't comment, so I didn't put it on the table. I did quickly stir up the pickin sauce and that was used by most. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for keeping Mean Chef's classic pork recipe alive, Bekah!

Roxygirl"
140132,26257,2008-06-11,5,"Wow!  This is THE pulled pork recipe to try.  This came out of the oven so tender and juicy, DH and DD couldn't quit eating it while shredding it.  THEN.....the sauce to put on top is TO DIE FOR.  I was in heaven!  I will definately be making this many times over.  Thank you for much for keeping this recipe alive, it is wonderful."
1179225,26257,2009-09-28,4,Very good and easy. I made the pig picken sauce and ended up using my own on the pork (DH thought it had too much vinegar). Thank you for posting!
126440,26257,2011-05-27,4,"Very good Pulled Pork.  We enjoyed this with fresh baked beans, coleslaw and pecan bars."
199848,155186,2006-05-23,5,"Easy and delicious!  I added chopped onion when I brown the beef.  The chips don't get soggy, they stay crisp.  This would be great to double and take to a potluck.  The whole family loved this.  Thanx for sharing this recipe; I'll make it again."
160974,155186,2007-10-25,4,"We served this over lettuce for a tasty taco salad and the leftovers rolled in a tortilla. Thanks Leilani, for posting. 

Roxygirl"
95743,155186,2008-01-17,5,"Made Dh sooo happy with this.  I used ground turkey, fat free refried beans, chipotle mango salsa and Taco Seasoning recipe #38756.  I left the chips out of the casserole, using them to dip."
140132,155186,2009-07-17,5,"Yummy!  I made this last night and it was a hit with my family.  I didn't have black olives so left them out, but will add them the next time.  I served this with salsa, sour cream, shredded lettuce and the chopped tomatoes.  I really liked the fact that I almost always have these ingredients on hand and can whip this casserole up in a flash.  This will be one of my ""go to"" recipes for those nights that we get home late and have running around to do.  Thank you so much for posting."
126440,155186,2010-01-23,5,I  made half a recipe and was great for the two of us with a little left over.  Used Recipe #50820 for the tortilla chips.  Topped with salsa rather than tomato.
173579,155186,2011-04-22,5,This was so yummy.  We really enjoyed it.  It was so simple to make.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
369715,155186,2011-06-06,4,"This was easy to make and we all enjoyed it. I didn't use the onions or olives because of my families tastes. We topped ours with the tomatoes, lettuce and sour cream. Easy weeknight meal to make."
422893,155186,2013-02-19,5,This was so easy to make & enjoyed by the whole family with the exception of the fussy almost 3 year old..I added some grated carrot & zucchini & chopped tomatoes to the mince mixture for added vegie content and it made enough that we have leftovers to freeze. We topped with guacomole & sour cream and chopped grape tomatoes. Thanks for posting!
173579,121490,2005-08-19,4,"Sorry, but we did not care too much for this bread.  Could have used more strawberries.  Thanks for posting."
209747,121490,2006-05-05,5,Holy WoW! This is some amazing stuff! Strawberries are in season right now and at their best so there is no better time to enjoy a wonderful treat like this! I did not use nuts or the sugar since the berries are so sweet and flavorful right now. Thanks for a delish recipe! 
89831,121490,2005-07-24,5,"I made two of these tonight using fresh blueberries, I increased the baking powder by 1/2 teaspoon, as I used quite a lot of berries (1 very heaping cup), and subbed almond extract for vanilla. The bread came out just beautifully! I can see why this recipe has so many great reviews, what a great recipe Cheryl! thanks for sharing, I be making this again....Kitten:)"
197023,121490,2005-10-29,5,"This Strawberry Bread is SO easy to make – such easy-to-follow instructions – and is every bit as delicious as it looks in Melody’s and Varsha’s excellent photographs.  And it really was fun to make.  I carefully perused all the reviews and followed several of the excellent suggestions made there.  This is obviously SUCH a versatile recipe: great!  I served it with ncmysteryshopper’s Decadent Strawberry Butter Recipe #121467.  WOW!  A taste sensation!  Rather than add extra strawberries as several reviewers had suggested, I made this bread with 3/4 cup of strawberries and 3/4 cup of raspberries (I love the slightly more tart flavour of raspberries) and I added 1/2 cup of chopped almonds instead of the optional walnuts.  Since I was adding almonds, I followed another reviewer’s suggestion and used almond essence instead of vanilla essence.  I followed Varsha’s suggestion of making this in a spring form pan; it made getting the bread out of the pan such a breeze!  Next time, I’m going to use Greek yoghurt in place of the sour cream.  This bread has a scrumptious blend of flavours and a lovely light texture, and those berries, WOW; and the Decadent Strawberry Butter, WOW!  I know that I’ll enjoy making slight variations probably every time I make it.  One thing’s for sure, next time I make this, I’ll be - at least - doubling the recipe!  And putting some in the freezer sounds like an excellent idea.  I think I’ll make the ones for the freezer in muffin pans: easy then to take out a few at a time.  And that way, they’d be great for picnics or for take to work lunches, and children’s lunchboxes.  Everyone absolutely loved this bread; and I’m really looking forward to sharing it with others.  Thank you so much for sharing it!  Another Zaar World Tour super-find!"
424680,121490,2007-04-11,5,"Great tasting bread [although my son called it cake, & ended up taking half the loaf home with him]! Very easy-to-make recipe, too. I served it topped with fresh sliced strawberries & a drizzling of homemade chocolate fudge! Thanks much for the posting!"
158086,121490,2007-07-17,5,"Made this for 4th july bbq and added some blueberries for the red white and blue motif.....was wonderful, everyone enjoyed it."
140132,121490,2008-01-08,5,Oh wow.  this was delish.  I love the strawberries in this and can't wait to try with other berries.  Thank you for this yummy variety of bread.....Stephanie
56003,121490,2008-08-06,5,"Just let me add my kudos!  Think I need to make every week as long as the strawberries hold out and freeze for a taste of summer during the winter.  Thnx for posting, NcMysteryShopper."
101823,4957,2006-03-17,5,Simple and great tasting.  You can adjust the seasoning to suit your own tastes or needs.  I used Taco Bell Taco Seasoning Clone (recipe #105993).  The chicken came out perfect and flavorful.  Excellent for enchiladas.
160974,4957,2007-03-27,5,"I've been eager to try this recipe, since I love having shredded chicken ready for recipes. I was a bit nervous about putting frozen chicken in the crockpot, but since so many others had done it with success, I thought I'd give it a try. I used a taco seasoning by Deb's Recipes. I used the chicken for chicken tacos and it was delicious. Next time I will definitely double the recipe to get a bag in the freezer. I will enjoy going through your ""leftover taco chicken cookbook,"" Pamela! 

Roxygirl"
140132,4957,2009-03-08,4,I used this recipe for a get together at my house.  We made a mexican themed potluck meal and I wanted something different.  Thank you Pamela this was a big hit at my party.
369715,4957,2009-10-26,4,Good and easy to make. I doubled the recipe but only cooked mine for four hours. I did taste them before putting in the freezer and they had a good taste to them.
176615,60350,2005-09-07,5,"Super fast and easy. Good basic recipe for traditional mac and cheese with a good amount of cheese sauce. My picky toddler had three servings, a record! No more complicated than the boxed stuff, but so much better. I'd put the servings at 4-6. Thanks, Marie!"
133174,60350,2007-04-05,5,"I am with LonghornMama, as posted this recipe serves 4 to 6 people.  I cut the recipe in  half and got 2 generous servings.  I used nonfat dry milk powder with 3/4 cup of water.  Part of the cheese was a smokey process cheese which added to the creaminess.  One of the reviewers mentioned a strong flour taste, I used 1 tablespoon of flour with 1/2 teaspoon arrowroot starch.  Served this with spinach and carrots for a deliciously quick meal."
653438,60350,2011-06-01,5,"Made this today for our lunch....so easy and delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and like some previous reviewers I used 1 Tbls. flour with 1/2 teas. arrowroot starch, added a little onion/garlic seasoning along with the salt and pepper and for the cheese I used about 3/4 cup cheddar cheese and 1/4 Velveeta for a little creamier sauce and poured over elbow macaroni.  One I will definately add to my Favorites of 2011...such comfort food!"
174096,60350,2012-07-11,5,"Simple and delicious.  I just wanted something fast and easy, and it's too hot to deal with the oven right now.  I subbed in gluten free flour and pasta and used 1% milk and 2% sharp cheddar.  It tasted great and had a nice creamy texture.  Thanks for sharing!"
369715,60350,2013-06-03,4,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe other then I used 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and used Velveeta cheese. My family enjoyed this and I did not have any issues with the amount of flour.
1179225,60350,2017-04-02,5,"Total keeper! I seasoned the flour with a little garlic powder and cayenne, used half cheddar and half velveeta. I did this because those were the flavors I was wanting and just used this recipe as a base recipe. Thank you for the perfect instructions. I'm excited to try different kinds of cheese and seasonings."
176615,129345,2011-05-08,5,Delicious! Doubled the lemon glaze and was glad I did. Made a lovely dinner. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
53932,129345,2005-08-11,5,I thought the capers were in perfect proportion to the sauce and the chicken.  I used butter and very much enjoyed the result.  Thanks for the recipe!
88099,129345,2006-07-08,5,Ah Kitz you done it again with this fabulous recipe.  I would not change a thing except double the sauce.  Wonderful combination of flavors and loved the lemon.  Thanks sweetie.  Made for a great dinner.
158086,129345,2007-05-15,5,This was one of the best recipes I have tried....I served this with lemon spaghetti #125120 and it was a 10 star meal for a monday...thanks...will put this one is my familes favorite recipes
482376,129345,2007-07-24,5,"Excellent chicken recipe and very easy!! I doubled the sauce ingredients (because I sure do love my sauce). If you have family members who don't love the taste of lemon, you can still create this dish for them and serve it without the sauce. Yum!"
173579,129345,2008-03-02,5,Very good chicken scaloppine.  My DH thought it was great.  We thought is was very tender. Thanks for posting this recipe.
452355,129345,2008-03-03,5,"DH and I made this for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it.  Based on other reviews, we decided to quadruple the broth and double the capers and salt in order to have extra sauce.  It turned out wonderful.  I think next time, I would not double the salt because my chicken stock is not low sodium and thus I found the dish a bit on the salty side.  We omitted the butter to make for a healthier dish and served with a side of asparagus.  Thank you for posting this keeper."
452940,129345,2008-03-10,4,"This was very simple to put together. I never used mustard in the eggs before so that was pretty cool. It did not overpower the other flavors at all, but added a nice little zing with the lemon. Overall, a nice dish. 
~B&B"
166642,129345,2008-05-07,5,"This chicken turned out moist and crispy. I used thin chicken breasts, perfect for scalloppine, and they cooked just as directed. I had never mixed egg and mustard but apparently it works and gave the chicken great flavor. I also doubled the sauce and it was good. Next time, however, I would omit the salt in the sauce because it was too salty for us. Thanks for another great recipe!"
133174,129345,2008-07-13,5,"DH and I agree this is very good.  I had intended to prepare the recipe for 2 and what I thought were 2 chicken breasts actually turned out to be 3.  Once flattened the chicken pretty much filled up a dinner plate. This recipe was perfect for using my warming drawer as only 1 breast could be cooked at a time and the others placed in the drawer to stay warm.  I did double the sauce and only had enough for 2 of the breasts.  I actually needed more bread crumbs and much more olive oil than called for.  After breading the chicken, I allowed it to stand on a rack for about 15 to 20 minutes to set the coating.  The chicken was moist and tender while having a wonderful crispy coating.  The other piece of chicken was sliced thin and will be used to make a salad tomorrow for lunch."
126440,129345,2009-03-12,5,Loved this Scaloppine.  I served it with Recipe #289520 and it made for a great meal.  Very filling and wonderful flavor.
140132,129345,2009-08-10,5,This is soooo good.  I really liked the egg mustard mixture.  I was only able to put 2 breasts in at a time but they stayed nice and warm on my tray.  I did double the sauce recipe and will do that next time too.  I served this with parsley buttered noodles and corn on the cob.  Thank you Kittencal for sharing yet another great recipe for my family.
653438,129345,2013-08-02,5,"Another winner!!!  Made this for our dinner cutting down on the chicken and using chicken tenderloins pounded down and left the sauce at the same amount.  I did use some panko crumbs with the breadcrumbs and added some capers.  (I breaded the chicken and like PaulaG I let them sit for about 15 minutes).  The chicken turned out to be so tender and DH loved this dish.  Definately an easy and quick dish on a hot summer night.  Served with fresh stirfry of broccoli, cauliflower, mushroooms and onions.  Wonderful.  Thank you for posting.  Going into my Favorites of 2013."
104295,27520,2005-10-01,5,"I am trying to use what is in my freezer and larder without going to the store for extras and I found a ton of ground beef.  So this worked well!  I used shallots and garlic (as I am out of onions), a large can of crushed tomatoes with Italian seasoning, and a smaller can of diced tomatoes.  I also used whole wheat pasta and added a can of kidney beans.  I served it with homemade herbed popovers.  A very filling meal. "
140132,27520,2008-02-21,4,"This was a good cheap meal.  We really liked this meal.  I served it with green beans and bread & butter.  Simple, fast, cheap, what could be better...thank you for posting....Stephanie"
653438,27520,2010-04-26,5,"I made this last night and it is a cheap meal and delicious. I cut the recipe in half and used diced tomatoes with chilies and 2 Tbls. of tomatoe paste. I did add some frozen corn and velveta cheese instead of cheddar to make it more creamy. I also added Mrs. Dash garlic/herb seasoning, some basil and a little oregano...turned out great. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that anyone can make as is or add to and turn out delicious!"
17803,27520,2011-07-22,5,"May 07, 2002...Quick, easy and dish meal and best of all everyone liked it.  This does make a large amount but no problem it well be gone the next day.  Kari thanks for sharing"
400708,27520,2013-05-27,4,"A quick, easy, inexpensive and pleasant meal that can be on the table in now time and only dirty one pot; great for those nights when you just don&#039;t want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen but still want that home made dinner.  It was a little bland for our taste so added 2 teaspoons of chili powder and 1 teaspoons of crushed red pepper and that seemed to work great for us."
140132,141983,2009-02-12,4,"Tastes good.  Yummy, yummy.  We love alfredo sauce and I have always bought it in a jar.  Those days are gone.  This is so good and cheaper then the kind in the jar.  Thank youfor posting."
89831,141983,2009-02-12,5,"I originally gave this 4 stars because the sauce was too thin, after allowing it to sit for a while the sauce thickened up so 5 stars for this! I did have to add in more Parmesan cheese to instensify the flavor to our tastes, thanks for sharing!"
204024,141983,2009-12-29,5,"We completely enjoyed this smooth, creamy sauce over linguine.  DD and DH both thought it could use a little herbal touch, possibly some finely chopped parsely, cilantro, or basil; we garnished it with cilantro which blended marvelously with the garlic.  We will be making this again."
176615,141983,2012-03-10,5,"Yummy and very easy! Not a traditional Alfredo (just butter, cream, Parm) but wonderful flavor from added seasoning. Mozzarella helps stabilize the sauce so it doesn't break down quickly and can even be reheated. I doubled the recipe with good results. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
428885,141983,2013-04-14,3,"This is a good recipe, and following it to exact, I can see that the mozzarella addition was grand, however, made it kinda gloppy. I had to keep it very warm and serve it right away so the cheesy factor (stringy) didn&#039;t mess with the dish. **(I might add no cheese or much less next time.) Thanks for posting delish dish!"
104295,132263,2008-01-25,4,"Very nice light pancakes.  I used white wheat flour, canola oil, and almond milk.  The only problem I had was that they are a little delicate and I had to watch the temp. on the griddle very closely.  Nice with some maple syrup."
173579,34499,2005-12-19,4,We really enjoyed this dish.  It was so moist and tender.  I did not cook this as long as was stated.  Will be making this many more times.  Thanks for posting.  
222564,34499,2010-11-29,4,Very flavorful chops baked in mushroom soup based sauce.
140132,34499,2008-01-07,5,This was great.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  I love chops made this way.  I served with white rice and a vegetable.  I really like the breaded chop with the sauce.....thank you.....Stephanie
8688,34499,2008-04-16,4,"The sauce for this recipe is delicious!  I used 4 1 inch beautiful boneless pork loin chops and substituted water for the wine. Unfortunately, my chops turned out dry. The cooking time at the top of your recipe said 2 hours, but in the recipe itself the cooking time stated 1 1/2 hours, which for pork chops I still felt may have been a bit long.  I used the 1 1/2 hour time however, next time I try these I may reduce the cooking time.  Delicious recipe, yooper. Thanks for posting!"
158086,34499,2008-07-09,5,"I loved this recipe....will have to make this for a family sunday dinner this winter...though I did change the baking time...1/2 hour without sauce then another half hour with sauce one,, 1 1/2 seemed way too long and mine turned out perfect cooking just one hour...."
369715,34499,2008-11-21,4,These were good and easy to make but we thought they could have used more seasoning. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used 8 thin pork loin chops so I cut the cooking time down. Next time I would add some seasoning to the gravy and some pepper to the chops.
126440,34499,2009-03-26,5,Great pork chops.  I made half a recipe but all of the sauce.  Great with Recipe #133821.
226863,34499,2009-04-11,5,"This was great!  I am not normally a fan of pork chops, but this recipe was so tender and yummy, I'll have to make it again.  I made this for Chef Alphabet Soup Tag 2009!  I'll have to add this to my favorites for 2009.  Thanks for posting."
305531,34499,2009-10-25,5,"Yum! I made this for one serving so had plenty of sauce for the chop and some mashed potatoes too. I used a Canadian seasoning that I received from my Canadian friend Nif. Really good stuff! Simple, quick, moist, and tasty. Thanks yooper for sharing. Made for Cookbook Tag."
176615,34499,2012-01-14,5,"Delicious! Was surprised how moist and tender the pork chops stayed. Took 4 more than one inch thick  pork chops and cut in half. There was plenty crumb mixture to coat my 8 chops generously; in fact, next time I'd reduce the crumb mixture by half. Used recipe #360192 with minced sautéed mushrooms rather than canned soup. Also, I cooked 40 before the sauce and 20 minutes after. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
29196,34499,2012-08-06,5,"We had these for dinner the other night-mummamills cooked them for us and I was so impressed. The recipe seemed VERY easy to put together, and the result was a delicious meal for us."
140132,80470,2009-12-06,5,"Oh my goodness, these are rich and delicious.  I made these for my kids while decorating the tree and we loved them.  These are going to be added to out holiday trays they are so good.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with me, its a keeper."
400708,80470,2009-12-19,5,"I've always had trouble making CC Cookies, mine always seem to flatten out and turn hard instead of the fat, soft, chewy ones my family loves.  Well, this changed all that.  Decided to try one more time as my family loves them and I wanted them on my Christmas tray - well these are perfect.  Fat, soft, pretty and taste great.  I left out the nuts (I'd prefer them) as several of our DGSs don't like them, but followed the recipe exactly right done to the timing and they came out perfect.  Thanks Steve for saving this Nanna from being a chocolate chip cookie failure."
176615,80470,2011-07-12,5,"Coming out of the oven, I thought these were the best cookies I'd ever eaten. Awesome! Even my husband commented how good they are, and I make a lot of cookies so he's not easily impressed:) They do crisp up as they cool, and would suggest watching the baking time, taking out before you think they're ""done."" I used light brown sugar, didn't chill the dough, used my Doughmakers cookie sheet with no parchment paper, and used about a tablespoon of dough for each cookie. Definitely a recipe I'll make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
37449,80470,2013-12-25,5,Made as part of cookie tins for Christmas. Very well recieved and enjoyed. Thanks Steve!
128473,80470,2017-03-23,5,"These made for some lovely chocolate chip cookies, light, tender, soft, chewy and delicious. I took them to a family event and boy were they devoured. The kids couldn't get enough of this tasty treat. Thanks for making me look like a star. Made for What's on the Menu Tag game."
8688,29679,2002-06-10,5,"There is no way this recipe could rate less than 5 stars!  Greyghost is right!  These DO taste exactly like Reeses!  These were so incredibly easy to do.  I made almost the entire recipe in my food processor and there was no mess!  These are fantastic and will undoubtedly be made again and again and again........Thanks for an excellent recipe, Karen!"
37449,29679,2003-01-07,5,"My husband and daughter were asking me for some Reese's peanut butter cups but I had run out! Soooo, looked on here and made these and they were more than satisfied! To make 1 1/2 cups grahm cracker crumbs, I used  12 grahm crackers, and ground them in the blender. Oh, I used cinnamon grahm crackers. Delicious!"
104295,29679,2004-10-14,5,"These taste like the ""Buckeye"" candies I used to make.  Very easy too, especially if you usually have graham cracker crumbs around.  (I buy them on sale at the off-price store.)  I made them for the youth director at my church, a young college guy who likes to take baked goods back to the dorm to share.  Thanks for such an easy tasty recipe!"
176615,29679,2005-04-11,5,"Really easy treat that everyone loves! This would be a great yet easy dish to bring to a pot luck or other function. I used a glass 13 x 9 dish, chilled well and didn't have any trouble getting them out. Thanks, Karen!"
101823,29679,2006-05-30,4,"Very much like a Reese's peanut butter cup.  I didn't have milk chocolate chips on hand and instead subbed semi-sweet.  That is excellent for the dark chocolate lover.  These were a bit crumbly and not quite the replicate of an elementary school lunch recipe that I have been craving.  I will continue my search for the perfect peanut butter bar.  Thanks for posting, though."
173579,29679,2005-06-16,5,This recipe is just wonderful.  Taste just like Reeses Cups.  I had my son over for dinner and served these for the sweet.  He thought they were the absolute best.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.   
222564,29679,2005-09-13,5,Yummmmm! No need to say more.
369715,29679,2007-08-28,5,My 8 year old and I made these for dessert tonight. The family loved them. Will make again.
140132,29679,2008-01-23,4,"Very good. Very rich but sooooo yummy.  I like the fact that they are so easy to make.  DH couldn't quit eating them and he doesn't have a sweet tooth, so that is one of the biggest compliments....thanks for posting....STephanie"
305531,29679,2011-05-15,5,Yum! I made 1/2 batch but should have made a full batch because my grandson and his friend finished these off in nothing flat. I added a little bit of cream to the chocolate and they turned out well. Thanks Karen for sharing this simple and great recipe. Made for I Recommend Tag.
400708,29679,2012-06-17,5,"So easy to put together with things I always have in my pantry.  And the taste; yum!!  Chocolate and PB, couldn't ask for any better.  Cut these small cause they are rich, but they won't last long, at least not in my house.  A perfect after dinner desert to serve with coffee or milk.  All the kids in my family voted them 2 thumbs up."
53932,13285,2005-08-05,5,Let me add my five stars.  These were really good.  I also used chopped onion and minced parsley.  Grilled them on my George Foreman and they turned out so much better than I expected.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
160974,13285,2005-12-15,5,"These were sensational tasting. The whole family enjoyed. Served on buns, with green salad and Tater Tots on the side. I pan fried these in a little olive oil and it formed a nice exterior crust. The way the feta gets creamy is  the best!

Roxygirl"
140132,13285,2007-01-30,5,"We loved this burger.  I have never made anything ""greek"" before so I wasn't sure how my family would react to this combo of flavors and ingredients, but they loved it!  I made Frank Butchers Tahini #3722 to go with it and they were fantastic....thank you for a new taste, wonderful recipe....Stephanie"
226863,13285,2009-01-27,5,"Oh Wow! I made this exactly as posted, and it was fabulous.  I ate this on Arnold Select Sandwich Thins, something new I found at the grocery store.  I can't stand the pita bread at the grocery store, and didn't have time to run to the greek market for fresh!  These sandwich thins were a cross between a pita and a hamburger bun, perfect for this burger!  Next time I'll throw some cucumbers and sliced onions on the bun with the burger.  And mix up some tzatziki sauce to use instead of the mayo.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  I loved it!  I made this for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Tag!"
126440,13285,2009-07-06,5,"Great burgers.  I did use chicken that I ground myself and served with Recipe #93401, Recipe #66596 and for dessert, Recipe #326367.  Great Greek meal."
176615,13285,2010-10-02,5,Yum! These were awesome burgers! Used kalamata olives and 2 t chopped fresh garlic. Feta adds so much flavor and helps keep the burgers from drying out. Leftovers were just as good. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
1179225,13285,2011-07-28,5,"Amazing burgers!  I agree with others that these would make grat meatballs. They were so easy to put together. I used mostly fresh herbs, but did add dried Pasta Sprinkle from Penzeys rather than Italian seasoning. I made the burgers in to sliders and froze the extra patties raw and look forward to grilling them soon. Thanks for this great recipe. I wouldn't change a thing."
173579,13285,2011-08-18,5,These are absolutely wonderful.  We loved the combination of flavors.  We will make these over and over again.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
37449,49387,2004-04-30,5,"I picked this for the chef of the day game. Lovely flavor, easy to make. Thanks so much!"
95743,49387,2005-01-22,5,"Outstanding!  This is just terrific and is now my favorite way to eat eggplant.  Crispy, cheesey outside, creamy, onion-flavored inside.  Not in a million years would I guess how healthy this is.  Wow."
140132,49387,2008-02-20,5,"OMG....this is awesome.  I like eggplant but my kids didn't.  However when they tasted this they ALL ate it, and liked it.  When they asked what it was they were a little stunned....lol.  I will definately be making this next summer when my garden is in full bloom....yummmmm i can't wait.   I really liked the mayo on these, it adds a different flavor and also the fact that they are baked instead of fried.  Thank you for posting this great recipe....Stephanie"
126440,49387,2009-03-10,4,Served with Recipe #19135 for a great meal.  Very easy vegetable to fix and you can be cooking something on the stovetop and not worry about it.
226863,49387,2009-05-20,5,"Very good! I used fresh eggplant picked fresh from my garden this morning.  I did salt my eggplant and let it sweat beforehand.  These are very easy to make and very tastey....they are like potato chips. Once you eat one, you have to eat another!  Thanks for posting!"
1179225,49387,2012-01-18,5,"We loved this recipe. I peeled the eggplant, used panko crumbs that I seasoned pretty heavy with fresh garlic, salt and pepper. I also  topped with mozzarella cheese and broiled the last couple minutes of baking. Served them on top of garlic spaghetti with a dollop of marinara sauce. So, so good! Thanks for posting this delicious and healthy recipe, can't wait to make it again."
29196,49387,2012-08-06,5,"Sensational! Our good friend mummamills made these for us for dinner last night-I can't believe how simple, tasty and healthy your method of cooking is. Thanks for posting."
140132,108364,2007-10-31,5,"MMMMMMMmmmmmm....you just cant beat southern fried chicken.  I don't fry my chicken very often but am glad I did this time.  I was worried the hot sauce would make it too hot for the kiddies, but they seemed to gobble up there pieces without noticing it.  Thank you for a truly great tasting chicken recipe.....
Stephanie"
37449,108364,2008-10-08,5,I used chciken legs and just a little hot sauce. My husband loved it! Thanks Sharlene!
126440,108364,2009-07-07,5,Great fried chicken.  I made half a recipe and used 2 chicken breasts cut into strips.  I only used 1/4 c. hot sauce as I didn't have any more.  Still had great flavor and easy to do.  Great served with Recipe #36501.

222564,108364,2011-04-14,5,Fantastic!
280271,108364,2011-05-12,5,DH loves fried chicken! I break down once a year and make it for him. This was the selected recipe for this year. He just raved about it. Very easy to prepare and it was tasty. Made as posted with the exception of cutting the recipe in half. And using shortening because I didn't have peanut oil. Cooked in my electric fry pan. Thanks for posting. :)
176615,108364,2011-07-10,5,"Wowza! This was the best fried chicken I've ever made or eaten. The family loved it. Not at all spicy, just perfectly seasoned. Just the right amount of ingredients for 8 thighs and 10 drumsticks. Used a deep fryer at 375 degrees, cooked drumsticks 13 minutes and thighs 18 minutes. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
160974,43509,2004-12-28,5,"This is my favorite banana muffin recipe. I love how high they rise. I add banana extract to the batter. Half the time, I don't even make the topping. They're that good!

Roxygirl in Colo."
140132,43509,2008-01-21,5,Yum....what can I say.  Banana muffins are good standing alone but then add the topping and they are over the top...delicious.  Thank you for posting....STephanie
8688,43509,2008-12-14,5,"Marvelous, Magnificent, Moist and Munchable Muffins!!  Tasty and moist, an unbeatable treat : ) Breakfast or snack, anytime at all! This simple recipe is sure to please the banana muffin lover in you ; )  Thanks for this super muffin recipe that will hold a special place in my cookbook, MizzNezzl!"
1072593,43509,2008-12-31,5,"This recipe is a ""best of the best"" in my book.  That equates to, ""I could literally live off these!""  My sweet tooth thanks you."
126440,43509,2009-01-08,5,Delicious!  I made these this morning and took some to school.  The comments were great.  I had one earlier and the flavor was very good.  The topping makes it.
158086,43509,2010-01-22,5,Wonderful muffins....they turned out perfect...
173579,43509,2011-06-08,5,Great Muffins.  Very moist!  Thanks for posting.
176615,43509,2013-07-02,5,"Really good! I omitted nuts in topping, otherwise made as stated. Only change I&#039;d make next time would be to make 15 muffins. With 12, the topping spilled out onto the pan. Maybe my bananas were larger than normal? Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
6357,26370,2002-11-24,5,"I made this for my dear brother's 18th birthday today. It is really moist, has an intense chocolate flavour, with the perfect balance of sweet. I baked 1 cake in my AMC Dutch Oven - took me 2 hrs 10 minutes to bake this, after which I let it remain covered in the oven for 30 minutes. The icing did sound unusual, but I went right ahead and made it - yummy! I had no shortening or butter, so I used 1 cup of softened margarine as a substitute. I didnt have regular milk at home, so I used     Rainbow Evaporated Milk as a substitute. When my bro got back from a game of pool with friends, and I surprised him with this cake, he was sooo happy! He made me feed him! :)
Thanks so much for sharing!"
176615,26370,2007-01-07,0,"I made the cake only, and used a caramel frosting. Used some of my morning coffee: I use dark roast and to most people it's at least double strength, but BOY did the cake have a nice flavor. Though it was rich, moist, and delicious, I had a problem. It came out of the oven looking absolutely beautiful and then fell completely flat. My cake turned into dense, rich brownies!! From a Q&A thread, I have determined that I overbeat the batter...I did run the beater up to high for a bit. Completely my fault, but thought I'd post this as a warning to others. Keep the beaters on medium only! Thanks, Karen, for sharing your recipe!"
286566,26370,2007-11-07,5,"Everyone has declared it as the best cake they have ever eaten even if it was not presented as intended.  Made in a large bundt tin but when turned out it fell apart (some sticking in the tin) so instead of serving with fresh cream and strawberries I layered the ingredients into a crystal bowl and served as a trifle without the custard and jelly (jello).  Still had cake left over and the DH took to work for morning/afternoon teas with custard - have orders to make again, but may divide it between 2 smaller tins.  Thank you Karen=^..^= for a definate keeper."
461834,26370,2007-11-24,5,"I made this for Thanksgiving when my daughter asked if any of the desserts were chocolate, lol!!!  I only made half the recipe, as I made two other pumpkin desserts.  Everyone loved this cake!!!  I made it with Kittencal's buttercream frosting, so yummy!!!!  Thanks for a great chocolate cake recipe!!!"
424680,26370,2011-07-26,5,"Although at first I really intended to top this with a chocolate frosting, I did follow your recipe right on down, to & including the frosting given, & it was a really outstanding cake! Loved it through & through, & will definitely be making it again & again ~ After all, there are 2 chocoholics in the house! Many thanks for the keeper recipe! [Made & reviewed in I Recommend recipe tag]"
140132,26370,2012-06-19,5,"So moist and rich.  Yummy.  I didn't use your frosting recipe because with opted to top it was ice cream and hot fudge.....omg so good.  The cake is very moist.  I'm glad you added in the instructions that the batter would be runny cuz I would have been worried.  This baked up so nice.  I have found our ""go to"" chocolate cake recipe.  Thank yo for posting you recipe.  So good. Edited to add:  DD made the frosting this time for the wonderful moist cake and it was fantastic.  So creamy and just the right amount of sweetness.  This cake is a winner from start to finish."
173579,26370,2014-11-03,5,Great recipe.  Thanks for posting.
39835,71373,2003-10-22,5,Excellent dinner rolls which went great with soup. Thanks DDW for sharing this wonderful bread recipe which we will be having often.
88099,71373,2005-10-02,5,"Okay, I'll jump in here.  These were absolutely great.  I am so bread challenged, but these even worked for me.  They turned out HUGE.  The taste and texture were just what I've been looking for.  DH told me I had finally made rolls that taste like his Grandma, and trust me, he has suffered through many tried recipes.  Thanks so much DDW.  I finally have THE KEEPER.  "
173579,71373,2005-11-01,4,I made the rolls.  I felt they were just ok.  Didn't have a lot of taste to them.  Thanks for posting.
8688,71373,2007-11-15,5,"I haven't tried this as rolls yet, but if the rolls turn out as great as the bread machine loaf, I can't wait to try it!  I used this recipe as my first trial run in my new bread machine and it worked perfectly! There was no need to add extra water or flour to the mix.  The bread rose beautifully and tastes great!  I served my first warm slice with some recipe #265593 and plan to try it also with recipe #90674.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, DDW!"
140132,71373,2007-12-03,5,"I've made both the bread and the rolls....these are delicious.  I'm not the best baker but this is fool proof.....thank you for this great and easy recipe....
Stephanie"
160974,71373,2007-12-03,5,"I've made this twice, making rolls and bread, and they both turned out great. I found the dough very easy to shape after I rubbed a small amount of shortening on my hands (as suggested).Both the rolls and bread were slightly airy and had a  sturdier texture when cooled.  Thanks DDW, for a dough recipe that I will make often.
Roxygirl"
126440,71373,2008-11-28,5,I have used this recipe for both rolls and bread.  Both are great.  I did add one half cup of wheat flour for the rolls this time. Thanks for sharing your great recipe.
428885,71373,2009-12-22,5,"Followed a previous reviewers helpful hint and added more salt, and these came out fabulous. This will be my go-to bread from now on. Its' really great!"
383346,71373,2013-06-18,5,I made dinner rolls and used 1/8 cup of sugar.  I didn&#039;t want them too sweet.  They have a light texture.  Great taste.  Thanks DDW :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game
400708,71373,2018-09-03,5,"Light fluffy and so pretty to look at, and to top it off so easy to make. Everyone at our get together raved about them. I'm planning on following reviewer Viclynn's freezing directions, so that I'll always have some on hand"
89831,75302,2004-06-23,5,"This casserole was just delicious! The only change I made was, I added about 1 Tbsp fresh chopped garlic in with the onions, celery and bell pepper, and used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned. I didn't have and angel hair pasta on hand, so I used spaghetti. Thank you Jellyqueen for such a wonderful casserole recipe, we really enjoyed it. I will definately be making this again, it was so good....Kittencal :)"
136997,75302,2004-07-10,5,This was delicious. I used a package of medium egg noodles instead. My husband took seconds even though he was full from firsts. Good sign it's a keeper.
158086,75302,2004-11-24,5,okay add me to the list who loves this recipe...very simple but tasty..i did not let mine simmer a whole hour as was pressed for time.  But still turned out fabulous...
169969,75302,2006-12-11,5,"WooHoo! Quick and easy! A total Man pleasing meal. Hearty and Delicious! Super easy to put together. I used about 2 pounds of ground beef since I had to use up what I had in the fridge. I used a combination of Mancheago, Cheddar and Parmesan Cheeses with Tubettini pasta. Delicious!"
140132,75302,2007-04-14,4,"This casserole was really good.  Simple to put together and we all liked it.  I will be making this again.  I liked the addition of the cream of mushroom soup, it really added a diffrent dimension to this pasta dish.  I did use thin spaghetti, but it didn't seem to effect the end result......Stephanie"
422893,75302,2007-09-05,5,"This was really yummy. Quote from DH ""You've kicked a goal with this one"" I made as directed except left out the celery & also added some bacon. I also used chicken mince instead of beef as that's what was on hand. Even my picky 2 year old DD gave this one a go so for that alone it's 5 stars.
Thanks for posting!"
383346,75302,2012-03-13,5,"wonderful recipe.  I used macaroni.  And I used a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes.  I used a little bit more of each veggies (celery, pepper, onion).  And I used fresh mushrooms that I added at the same time as the previous veggies.  The mushroom soups adds a wonderful taste to the whole dish.  It gives a lot and it's perfect for the lunches at work/school.  Thanks Jellyqueen :)  Made for All you can cook buffet"
169969,50144,2005-12-09,5,I needed a recipe for lunch for someone who works outside in the bitter cold (thermos)that would be ready and hot at 5 AM to throw together. This recipe fit the bill. He said it was delicious! I put the bacon pieces and chives in a plastic baggie and he added them as he ate the soup. I love the ease of this recipe! Very simple and still has wonderful flavors!!! Thank  you for posting!
53932,50144,2005-12-10,5,"This is very good!  As I was eating it I was thinking it would taste even better with onions--Sheesh, I left them out!  I did use ham instead of bacon and sprinkled a little shredded cheddar on the soup when serving.  "
482376,50144,2007-11-19,5,"My kids went crazy over this soup. I made it on a Saturday, refrigerated it, and then served it for lunch on Sunday. I really think that the flavor and consistency was better the next day (I had tasted it when it was finished on Sat. night). Sprinkling it with bacon was the icing on the cake. Yummy!!"
101823,31750,2005-02-12,5,"Wonderfully crisp waffles with great flavor. Easy, quick and yummy. Who could ask for more? ***editted to add***I reheated the leftover waffles in the toaster and had a great breakfast for a couple of days later.  These were perfect waffles."
158086,31750,2005-02-21,5,Very easy recipe...puffed up beautiful....a real keeper
173579,31750,2007-01-30,5,These are the best waffles you will ever put in your mouth.  So tasty and delicious!  Will be making these from now on.  Thanks for posting such a fabulous recipe.
140132,31750,2008-02-21,5,"We love waffles on Sunday mornings.  (who am I kidding, we love them ALL the time...lol)  I made these and they turned out perfect, crisp outside and soft inside....delicious.  thank you for posting....Stephanie"
176615,31750,2010-03-21,5,"Fantastic waffles! Buttery and light, crispy on the outside. The family ate them with warm maple syrup as fast as I could make them. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
428885,31750,2011-01-01,5,"These are exceptional! I love, love, love, the egg-whites that are whipped to stiff peaks and then slowly being incorporated into this mix. These came out perfectly --> and since the ""appear"" lighter - people ate more, and left none for the cook, (me). Either way, sensational and you know you have a lovely recipe that can and obviously will be handed down to off-spring. Thanks for posting!! The Longmeadow Farm loved this!"
560491,31750,2013-05-07,5,So good!  I liked the crisp on the outside and they got a little dark but were still moist and fluffy on the inside.  I used my hand mixer for the egg whites to make sure they were stiff enough to not break down completely when they were folded in.  Made for Name that Ingredient Tag.
140132,80156,2011-01-04,5,"We loved this recipe.  We included these in our 2010 holiday trays for family and friends.  What I liked the most from these cookies is they stayed soft even after a couple days.  The kids had a blast decorating them, we used both a boy and girl cookie cutters.  The flavor of these are delightful and just screams the holidays.  Also, the house smell so wonderful when baking these.  Thank you for sharing this gem of a recipe."
8688,89207,2005-07-03,5,"Another winning recipe submitted by our gracious Kittencal!  This frosting is the perfect complement for my chocolate cake.  Easy and quick to prepare for a chef in a hurry ; )  Thanks again, Kitten!"
128473,89207,2007-06-20,5,"This frosting is delicious, thick, light, rich, creamy and chocolaty. The perfect blend of chocolate, butter, cream and icing sugar. I made the medium version with half and half cream, wonderful just wonderful... Kudos Kitten for another winner, I can't wait to try the other versions, thanks for sharing."
140132,89207,2007-08-15,5,"MMMMMM  I loved this frosting.  I made this to go along with #2496 Dark chocolate cake and it was wonderful.  I've never made a buttercream frosting before and I'm not sure why i waited so long. Delicious.  Thank you , this was great......Stephanie"
176615,89207,2007-09-12,5,UMMM! Used the dark rich version and highly recommend it. Could have eaten the entire bowl with a spoon but managed to save some for the recipe #2496. Suggest sifting cocoa and powdered sugar together. Why buy the gross stuff in the can when this is so easy and uses ingredients you can pronounce? Made for DH's birthday and will use again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
383346,89207,2008-01-24,5,"I did for dark rich.  I used unwhipped whipping cream cause I didn't have enough half-and-half.  I put this frosting on the cake recipe#262773   But since I did half the cake, I should have done half frosting.  I have leftovers in the fridge.  I guess I'll have to do another cake LOL  Thanks Kit :)  Made for Zaar Star Game."
204024,89207,2008-02-03,5,"Just super easy and super rich. Worked first time, came out delicious."
166642,89207,2008-02-24,5,This is a wonderful chocolate buttercream. I used it on a cake for my son's birthday and he loved it. I'll be sure to use this again for many baked goods I make!
80353,89207,2008-10-10,4,"Very good.  It looked a little grainy in the mixing bowl, but frosted nicely on the cake.  I would have liked to have been able to beat it a little longer to get rid of the powdery flavour of the icing sugar,  but I was afraid of the cream curdling (the graininess?) and stopped."
1179225,89207,2011-09-09,5,"Fantstic! So smooth and rich, just loved it. I used milk and 3/4 cup of cocoa. I can't imagine it turning out any better made with cream, but I'll try it next time just to be sure. Thanks so much for posting this perfect chocolate frosting recipe!"
140132,106627,2009-02-22,4,This is a good squash recipe.....thank you for posting.
29196,48760,2002-12-22,5,"Russell cooked this for our dinner tonight. He said it was fast, and easy to make, and I reckon it was fantastic to eat! Such a yummy way to use mince and vermicelli. Thanks Sharon."
140132,4627,2005-09-25,5,"This is a very delicious soup.  I have never tried any other recipes for tortilla soup and won't be trying any either. We all loved this recipe. It was so easy to prepare , and you gotta love that .  A big thank you from yet another satisfied chef..."
95743,4627,2006-01-13,5,"I suppose the last thing this recipe needs is another long-winded review, so I'll keep this brief; AWESOME."
222564,4627,2007-02-22,5,"This soup is awsome, I mean REALLY awsome! The flavor is simply fantastic! I happened to taste it before adding the milk and cheese, and it was already superb, so it can be had cheesy or not. We had it as written and used tortilla chips, sour cream and cilantro to garnish. Yummyyyy."
158086,4627,2007-07-18,5,Waht an easy weeknight soup recipe....I added some corn to it but otherwise followed recipe...we really enjoyed it....
226863,4627,2007-09-20,5,"This soup deserves all the 5 star ratings!  It was delicious before adding the cheese and milk, so you could reduce the calories that way.  I used low sodium taco seasoning to make it healthier, and used 2% cheese and fat-free half and half to lower the calories.  The recipe was still delicious.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it over and over again!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!"
160974,4627,2008-10-11,5,"This was really excellent! The whole family loved. I used a rotisserie chicken and pureed two fresh tomatoes for the canned (I did use the diced with chilies as required). I went pretty light on the spices, but it still had a nice kick. I did toast the chopped tortillas in the skillet. I used shallots for the onions and did not have celery.

Roxygirl in Colo."
126440,4627,2009-04-04,5,"I made half a recipe using one can of Rotel but no tomatoes, and masa for thickener. The flavor was great but next time I wouldn't use as much masa.  I used 1/2 c. masa and let it warm for about 30 min.  that could have been the problem.  I served with a quick cheese quesadilla."
176615,4627,2009-04-10,5,Really enjoyed this soup. Made as directed and it was perfect. My son also likes corn and black beans added which is a nice variation. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
1179225,4627,2009-10-24,5,"We all loved this soup. I have made other tortilla soups and have always been disappointed. Not this time. I used masa and loved the flavor it added. I'm really looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks so much for posting your delicious recipe, I'll be making this again for sure."
482376,4627,2010-11-05,5,"FABULOUS! Loved this recipe!! The flavor for an excellent chicken tortilla soup is ""spot on"" here. The only change I will make next time is to try omitting the cheese from the cooking process and just using it as a garnish. I thought the soup was already perfect before adding the cheese! Thanks for posting. :)"
4470,48760,2005-11-17,5,"Nice heat- spicy but not ""take your head off spicy""  I used fat noodles instead of vermicelle.. Lovely to have this tasty meal on the table in under 30 minutes.  Recipe made as posted except I used 1 tbsp Sesame oil.  I made the full recipe and have 3 servings ready for the freezer. I did not put the noodles in with the beef.  When I defrost one I will try it with the rice vermicelli  ThanksSharon123 - great recipe"
160974,48760,2006-01-03,5,"I've made this twice and the family loves it. The first time I didn't have fresh ginger and that makes a huge flavor difference. I use 1/4 hoisin sauce and that is enough for our tastes. Just as good with spaghetti noodles, too. We will make this regularly. Thanks, Sharon!

Roxygirl"
136997,48760,2006-06-30,4,This was very good and I think it would taste even better if I remember to put in the ginger the next time. LOL!
169969,48760,2006-08-10,5,"Delicious! This recipe is perfect for busy weeknight chefs or chefs on a budget! It is quick to put together and is really delicious. It is one of those recipes that  further your meat without sacrifice to the flavor - nor does it leave you feeling that it is a budget meal. This will be made again and again in our household. The Asian spices and condiments are a wonderful addition to the ground meat and noodles... who would have thought?! I did not have cornstarch so I subbed a Tablespoon of flour and this worked well and did not interfere with the taste of the recipe. The heat was perfect for us at 1 1/2 teaspoons. BTW, I had to make this recipe after seeing peacefulnightdove's photo! Thank you so much Sharon."
89831,48760,2006-09-15,5,"I wish I could rate this way more than 5 stars, this recipe is FANTASTIC! I pretty much made this as stated only with a couple minor amount adjustments, I am going to try this using pork or beef strips next time, we loved this, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten:)"
39835,48760,2006-12-30,4,"Very good over rice. This is a good emergency meal, as I have most of the ingredients on hand all the time and it goes together quickly. Thanks for sharing!"
140132,48760,2007-01-30,5,Yummmmmmmy!  I printed this recipe a while ago and finally got around to making it.....what was I thinking!  This is fantastic and we loved it.  I was a little concerned it would be a bit too spicy for my youngest but he had two helpings.....We will be making this alot. I used spaghetti instead of the vermicelli and only used half the crushed red peppers and it suited us perfect.....thankyou for a great recipe....Stephanie
280271,48760,2007-03-01,5,"1st review: Excellent dish that came together with ease. I had all the ingredients on hand. DH gave it a big thumbs up. It had a nice spicy kick to it. I will be making this again. Thanks for posting. Update: 3/1/07 Here I am again! This time I made it with ground Turkey and whole wheat vermicelli. It still came out excellent! Whenever DH says ""This is really good!"" I know I have a winner. This has such a great flavor to it. It's also so easy to make. Happy cooking! Thanks, again Sharon123 for posting."
158086,48760,2007-04-26,5,What this does to plain old ground sirloin is unreal....I was told this was orgasmic....so I take that as good....will be making this often with the reaction I got from it...haha
452355,48760,2007-09-16,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe and thought it was very flavorful, while being easy to prepare.  I did not have a problem with the sauce yield, as mentioned by other reviewers.  Definitely a keeper!"
222564,48760,2008-02-04,4,Very tasty and quick to prepare!
199848,48760,2008-02-05,5,"I never thought I'd get excited over ground beef!   This is perfect for when you are just sick and tired of the same-old ground beef recipes.  I made this just as written, but doubled it (I didn't double the red pepper flakes though).  This has tons of great flavor.  I served this with steamed cauliflower.  Thanx for posting this.  It is a keeper for sure!"
163112,48760,2008-02-10,5,"Easy & excellent.  Everybody loved this!  Made for the Chinese/Vietnamese New Year Tag.  Thanks, Sharon!"
369715,48760,2008-02-10,4,We had this for dinner tonight. We thought it was really good. I first doubled all the ingredients other then the hoisin sauce and red pepper. We didn't think it had enough sauce though so I then tripled the sauce. This suited our tastes and we all thought it was good. I also didn't add the green onions on top as my kids wouldn't have eaten then :)
226863,48760,2008-12-09,5,"This was a very unique recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  I love the convenience of ground beef, although I used ground chuck because that is what I had.  But next time I think I will slice some sirloin really thin and use that.  I will also double the sauce and add some vegetables...broccoli and carrots, maybe some red bell pepper.  I absolutely love the flavor of the sauce, there just wasn't enough of it!  Thanks for posting a really tasty recipe!  Made for Everday is a Holiday tag."
126440,48760,2009-07-12,5,Great Szechuan noodle.  I made this minus the beef and served it with Recipe #187477.  Very filling meal.
286566,48760,2010-02-21,5,"Cheap to make and Oh so good and flabourable.  I did serve over rice once I found out I didn't have the vermicelli noodles in the pantry - but the DH was disappointed there wasn't left overs as he felt the mince with the rice would be great in toasties and he wants to try it with the noodles and the big one was it had a spicy bite which even the DM devoured.  After making though and the reason ours may have been so spicy was that I used dried crushed chillies [1 teaspoon] (home grown and I know they are hot) but that is also what we usually buy here in Australia (my awareness now is that crushed red peppers are dried red capsicum/bell peppers) but would recommend the chillie option if you like spice and hot.  Thank you Sharon123 for a great recipe, made for Potluck Tag."
176615,48760,2012-12-20,5,"Made a good, quick dinner. Served with edamame. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
486725,48760,2013-12-08,5,"Oh my, this was delicious! I originally reviewed this a while back, but found myself craving it again it was so good. Now I am upgrading it from a favorite to a best of the year! It does take a bit of time to prepare, but it is worth it. We thought the amount of soy, hoisin and sauce was just perfect, and not sweet at all for us. I used ground turkey and halved it, so that I would have room for some veggies (a red bell pepper and mushrooms, as other reviewers did - the second time I also added water chestnuts). In addition, I at least doubled the ginger, used 1/4 tsp of the crushed red pepper and just drizzled the sesame oil over at the end (so used far less). It went perfectly with rice noodles, but I am sure it would also be great over rice. I bet tofu would work super in this too, if you are a vegetarian. Thanks for a fabulous meal!"
176615,43023,2005-10-08,5,"Delicious, quick side dish. I doubled the garlic and otherwise wouldn't change a thing. Creamy without being heavy. Homemade stock will add the best flavor. Thanks, Karen, for posting!"
209747,43023,2006-08-23,5,"Wonderful, fast and easy! Thanks for a great recipe that I will fall back on for lots of different meals!"
158086,43023,2007-07-23,5,loved this recipe...I made it with beef broth and added a little shallots....was a great side dish and so easy....everyone raved about it...
173579,43023,2012-04-15,5,I had this for a family gathering.  Everyone loved it.  It was so simple to make.  Thanks for posting.
1179225,43023,2012-08-30,4,"This was a very simple and tasty sauce. I served with it over spaghetti and topped with meatballs. I only used a 1/2 lb. of pasta, but made the full recipe for the sauce.Thanks for posting."
560491,43023,2013-09-17,5,"This was great!  My DSs do not eat potatoes or rice so they eat a lot of pasta sides; they like Pasta Roni, but I don&#039;t like all the preservatives so this is a great alternative!  I decreased the amount of garlic by 1/2 so they would like it and served with breaded chicken cutlets.  Will be making this often and getting away from Pasta Roni!  Made for Name That Ingredient Tag."
169969,21882,2004-12-29,5,"This dish was so good I just had to post another 5 star review! Great flavor and so easy. I prepared it exactly as written except I put the mushrooms under the cheese and used prepared pesto. I covered the dish for first 20 minutes with a sheet of foil so the cheese would not burn. Excellent! I served it with bowtie pasta with pesto,  Artichoke Bruschetta(#103152) and Walnut/Cranberry salads. Thank you for posting this great recipe!"
160974,21882,2005-05-08,5,"I made this for our Mother's Day dinner. I did coat my chicken with flour, egg wash, and seasoned bread crumbs and sauteed til almost done, and baked with the sauce. I added freshly sauteed mushrooms on half of chicken pieces. I really thought the mushrooms made it special, but not everyone in my family appreciates mushrooms the way I do! I did use Knorr packet of pesto sauce. Even though my chicken didn't need to bake long to cook through, I covered it with foil so it would stay ""melty."" I served this with my Giardiniera Lasagna  recipe #117371, which complemented each other nicely. This is a great chicken dish for company.

Roxygirl in Colo."
95743,21882,2005-07-02,5,"Scrumptious. Skipped the breadcrumbs, used fresh mushrooms and homemade pesto.  I put the chicken in the dish, topped with half the pesto, raw mushrooms, remaining pesto and then provolone.  Twenty minutes seemed plenty of time to bake the breasts. The liquid from the mushrooms waters down the pesto but sauteing them first until dry would avoid that problem.  "
140132,21882,2009-03-06,5,DELICIOUS!!!  I love pesto and adding it to chicken is amazing.  My family really enjoyed this dish and has requested it to be made often.  Thank you for posting.
158086,21882,2009-06-04,5,Add us to the list of the many people that have loved this recipe...I too put the mushrooms on before the cheese...I doubled the pesto sauce and glad I did...I used chicken tenderloins and it turned out perfect...looking forward to the leftover tonite.
323186,21882,2009-06-24,5,"Very good!   Made as directed, using fresh mushrooms.    I found the breadcrumbs coated nicely just as described,  and another time I might well use more cheese.  I used homemade basil pesto,  and if I had looked at other photos before making this, I would have put the cheese over the mushrooms..  next time!
The chicken baked perfectly (I covered the dish with foil for the first 20 mins), and my family really enjoyed something a little different, thanks for this great recipe!"
126440,21882,2009-07-03,5,"I made this for two and used pesto, and fresh sauteed mushrooms.  Very easy to do and has wonderful flavor.  Served it with Recipe #30051."
386585,21882,2012-01-18,5,"This has it all - ease of preparation and fantastic flavor!  What's not to like?  I took the suggestion of Svetlana's review, using refrigerated pesto, fresh mushrooms and adding artichokes.  Delish!"
101823,106627,2005-01-01,5,The roasting brings out the wonderful sweetness of the butternut squash.  This is an excellent side dish that would compliment many meals.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar slightly and the dish was still scrumptious.
4470,106627,2005-09-01,5,"Delicious - I cut back on the sugar, roasted for 50 minutes cooked perfectly outside still firm lovely soft centers. great flavor  Thanks for a Keeper Piano lady"
176615,106627,2005-10-21,5,"Excellent! I can't think of a vegetable I DON'T like roasted, but this makes butternut squash fantastic. Be sure to let the outside of the squash get nice and brown, I think it adds a great deal more flavor. What a wonderful fall side dish. Thanks, Pianolady!"
160974,106627,2005-11-30,5,"The carmelization that occurs with the butter and brown sugar really makes some ""magic"" in the oven. A lot of times I skimp on salt, but have found that Ina Garten knows the right amount for her recipes. It really accents the flavors.

Roxygirl"
169969,106627,2006-03-16,5,Add me as a fan too! This was super easy and really good! The picky four year old actually ate it without argument! I did not find it as sweet as I thought it would be. It was perfect! I tossed everything in a bowl and then spread it out on a baking sheet. Thank you for a great squash recipe.
158086,106627,2007-09-26,5,This is out of this world....We loved it...going to put this recipe in my holiday cookbook as it would be great for thanksgiving and you could make it ahead of time....the hardest part is peeling that darn thing... I used splenda brown sugar and it was perfect.
1072593,106627,2010-07-11,5,"I had a butternut squash in my pantry for about 2 weeks and everytime my grandson would see it he'd say, ""Why you have Jerry?"" I'd think who the heck is Jerry?!? Come to find out he's a cartoon character. Well, I loathe the thought of telling him, Jerry's now a goner. On a happier note, this recipe is magical. Turns squash into candy."
126440,106627,2010-11-13,5,I have made this a number of times and just love it.  I usually only do one squash for the two of us and we still have leftovers for snacking.
653438,106627,2011-01-26,5,"Made this last night and it was a big hit with everyone.  I cut the recipe in half and the salt a little but followed the rest of the instructions.  I am putting this into my Favorites of 2011 book.  Served this with Tri-tip steak, green beans, paprika/butter fried potatoes and the Realtor's Italian Salad Dressing#384154/salad.  P.S.  I will add a little more brown sugar for my own sweet tooth."
227978,106627,2012-02-29,5,"Positively fantastic recipe.  We all really enjoyed the lovely flavors at play here.  I did coose to slice off the skin though, because my kids don't care for having the skin intact when I oven roast winter squashes.  So, to be assured my kids would actually eat it and get a serving of vegetables in, it was well worth the little extra time it took to peel my butternut squash.  Even though it's just fantastic as is, I'd still like to make this recipe again and try some of the changes suggested by other reviews, perhaps a touch of cinnamon or cayenne and maybe a handful of chopped nuts for a little extra crunch.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Pianolady.  It was a big hit in my family."
222564,106627,2012-12-09,4,"Very good basic recipe, herbs and garlic etc. could be added. I like the notion in a review about not peeling the butternut squash. Most of the goodness is in the peel usually."
133174,83524,2005-03-19,5,I will add my review to the 37 that have posted already.  This is so simple and delicious. I have used something similar for years.  I did add a sprinkling of fennel and some dried minced onion flakes.  Cooked it in my treasured cast iron skillet and served it with left over corned beef.  This is a keeper. 
101823,83524,2006-02-02,4,"This is simple comfort food for my husband.  He loves cooked cabbage.  I used half of a head of napa cabbage for the two of us, and he gobbled it all up.  It paired nicely with Turkey Meatloaf (recipe#77992) and Garlic Mashed Sweet Potatoes (recipe#123557)."
226863,83524,2007-01-30,5,"This is the way my grandmother taught me to cook cabbage.  She always loved it with pork chops, corn bread, and fresh crowder peas....with homemade fried apple pies for dessert!  But I have found you can adapt this recipe to a lower fat version using Smart Balance spray or Pam to coat the pan.  If it starts to stick, add a little water.  It will still carmelize nicely if stirred occasionally.  Chopped green onions or minced garlic also adds a nice flavor.  This is a wonderful recipe as is....everyone should try it.  I didn't know it as ""frizzled cabbage"", just as plain old fried cabbage. It's always been a staple at my house."
140132,83524,2008-02-21,4,"Very good.  I made this for dinner last night and my family enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling it.  We loved it ,thank you for posting"
369715,83524,2009-01-07,5,Easy and wonderful. I made this for my dinner as no one else in my family eats cabbage. I put the cabbage on my plate and my youngest asked if he could try it. He ended up eating it all and I had to make more. This was so easy to make and very tasty. Loved this and I will be making more often.
158086,83524,2009-03-17,5,This was really really good....we ate it all up...
53932,83524,2011-04-23,5,Simple and excellent!  Nicely sweet.
1179225,83524,2012-07-10,5,We love cabbage and this recipe made us love it even more. This would be a great noodle replacement if low-carbing. I'll be making this recipe often. Thanks for posting.
1072593,83524,2015-04-12,5,"Cabbage helps rhythms of the body. ;-) Ok, now let&#039;s get back to the spirit of cooking.  What&#039;s wrong with ya&#039;ll?"
39835,33919,2002-07-23,5,"This casserole is great! It was easy to put together and used ingredients we had in the house.
All four of us had second helpings, with leftovers for lunch.
I did use low-fat versions of the refried beans, shredded cheese, soup, and sour cream to cut down on the fat, and next time I make it I will probably add a green pepper (chopped).
Thanks for this recipe. It is definitely a keeper."
173579,33919,2005-06-17,4,"This was good.  I agree with Mystergirl that the taco seasoning was a little overpowering, at least for our taste.  Will decrease and try again.  Thanks for posting this recipe."
140132,33919,2006-12-15,4,"I really liked this recipe b/c of the convenience of it.  I always have these ingredients in my pantry and its quick , so perfect for the kids sports nights and time is tight....thank you for a good fast meal.....Stephanie"
158086,33919,2008-09-13,5,This was very good...I will make this for one of our Family Sunday Winter dinner this winter as I think it would go over well.
369715,33919,2009-01-28,4,We are in the middle of an ice/snow storm and we were out of electricity. I had a pound of ground beef pulled so decided on this. I followed the recipe exactly as written other then I used a white onion as that is what I had. I also used Recipe #154235 for the taco seasoning packet as I didn't have any and I wasn't running out for any. I also made this on the grill since I didn't have electricity and it came out really well. My kids don't like sour cream but I thought it was hidden enough being mixed with the soup but they still noticed. The recipe doesn't say what size pan to use so I used an 11 x 13 pan. Next time I would use a smaller pan as it didn't fill out the bigger pan. Hubby and I enjoyed this for dinner tonight.
560491,33919,2009-03-16,5,This is soooo goocd!!!  I made last month and froze it; I just had a baby so it was good to have to throw in the oven and cook.  Both DH and I had seconds and I had for lunch for the next 3 days!!  I used cream of chic soup rather than mushroom and it was very creamy!!  Will be making when I visit family next month in AZ.
126440,33919,2011-12-06,5,I added hot sauce in the middle of the layers and thought it was great.  Easy casserole and have a little left over for lunch tomorrow even though I made half a recipe.
176615,33919,2012-01-25,5,"The family enjoyed this! Easy, too.  Used 3 cups of cheese, 8 regular-sized tortillas, and a can of organic mushroom soup. Didn't find the dish dry as some have commented. Didn't add salsa or rotel. You could, but definitely not necessary. Thanks for the recipe!"
1179225,33919,2012-08-10,5,"What a quick, tasty and filling dinner. I used ground turkey and added a bell pepper and jalapeno while cooking, used 4 tortillas and added some fresh salsa when layering. I'm looking forward to the leftovers. Thanks for posting."
8688,15242,2002-02-26,3,This recipe cries out for ham.  Either some diced ham in the casserole or to be served with either a baked ham or fried ham steak with Lima beans and some cornbread.  I halved the recipe to serve 4 and cooked an extra long time at a lower temperature after the orginal baking time to make an extra crispy crust on top.
53932,15242,2005-03-25,5,Made this exactly as written and it was very good.  It does make a lot so will make just half the recipe next time.
179133,15242,2005-03-25,4,I don't know if its like Cracker Barrel but I thought it was pretty good. I made half the recipe and cut the butter to 2 Tbsp. It fit in a 2 qt. casserole. I added more pepper because I like lots of pepper on hashbrowns. Thanks!
140132,15242,2008-01-19,4,This was good.  I made it last night to go with our pork chops and it was enjoyed by all.  Thank you for posting....STephanie
126440,15242,2014-02-09,5,So good.  Had two baked potatoes to use and added about 1/2 c. soup and sour cream.  No butter but cheese on top.  YUM.
173579,22176,2005-08-11,5,This was the best Ziti recipe that I have found.  I liked all the parmesan cheese that it had in it.  Very flavorful.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for posting.
157425,22176,2009-08-08,5,Love baked ziti and this was a great recipe. I dont like a heavy amount of italian seasonings so this one worked great for me. I used two cans of Hunts cheese and garlic spaghetti sauce and 1 1/2 pounds of ground round. Yummy!! Thank you Caryn for posting this recipe. Made and reviewed for the Iron Chef tag game.
369715,22176,2011-06-14,5,This was easy to make and wonderful tasting. I followed the recipe as written and we all loved it. Hubby said it could have used some pepper though so next time I would add that to the sauce. This makes a lot and it was just as good as leftovers the next day.
47892,65340,2008-10-13,5,"Original revivew 1 Oct 08: Instead of 24 rolls I made 12 large rolls which required a little bit more baking time.  I placed the rolls on a parchment lined jelly roll pan; (lightly buttered the parchment paper first.) If you want a buttery, rich, fluffy dinner roll recipe, this is the one! These rolls should be a requirement anytime you served mashed potatoes! Forgot to mention that I reduced temperature to 350 degrees. cg"
323186,65340,2008-10-21,5,"Extremely good, and simple to make in the bread machine.  I made small cocktail rolls to put on  the buffet lunch table for friends.   I brushed the tops with butter and sprinkled with white sesame seeds.
Definitely a keeper!"
176615,65340,2010-12-31,5,"Excellent rolls! I make a lot of yeast rolls and these were fantastic. Light, wonderful flavor, and the dough is very easy to work with. Only change I made was to use regular unbleached flour with the addition of 2 T vital wheat gluten (I stopped buying bread flour years ago). Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
383346,65340,2012-03-19,5,They are so easy to do.  Easy to roll into balls.  They were great out of the oven with butter.  Thanks jean :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
101823,108522,2005-02-19,5,"Great simple grilled cheese.  I didn't taste a noticeable difference in using mayo instead of butter.  I came away with crispy, toasted bread and gooey melted cheese.  It is the perfect sandwich for tomato soup."
8688,108522,2005-03-13,5,"""Mayo on grilled cheese?"" ""Never!"", I said. I had never heard of this technique before until now. When I saw your recipe, like others, I had to try it right away. Crispy brown and beautiful! This makes a lovely sandwich : ). I used a mild cheddar and just a touch of sugar on the inside, like I always make my grilled cheese sandwiches. Thanks for sharing this, Dawn! "
176615,108522,2005-03-21,5,"What a wonderful and easy idea! Makes a crispy sandwich, nicely browned, in no time! I tried this with lowfat mayo but much prefer it with full fat mayo. They brown quickly so watch out! Thanks Dawnab, I'll use this method often!"
53932,108522,2005-03-26,5,Add me to the list of converts!  Who knew a grilled cheese sandwich could be any better?  The bread was evenly and nicely toasted and the mayo added a bit of flavor.  This is the only way I will ever make grilled cheese from now on.  Thanks for sharing!
95743,108522,2005-04-11,5,"Yep, this is the default grilled cheese recipe from now on.  As others have noted, it doesn't change the taste, just spreads easily and grills up beautifully."
29196,108522,2005-05-21,5,"I love pan fried sanwiches with any sort of filling-not just cheese. It's the very simple method that earns this its 5 stars. No torn bread, not big blobs of butter. It works so simply and leaves no taste of the mayo, just crispy, fluffy, perfectly browned sandwiches. Thanks for teaching this old dog a new trick that she will perform often!"
88099,108522,2005-05-29,5,"Okay, I hooked on the Mayo thing.  What a great idea.  It browned so nicely and was very crisp, just like I like them.  I made mine with the mayo and DH's with butter and he could really tell a difference in the crispness of the bread.  Thanks so much."
160974,108522,2005-06-04,3," I was curious about this recipe, although we are very partial to the traditional buttered sandwich. It seemes like if your turn too early or pan temp isn't right, it sticks to the pan than with cooked with butter. For my second sandwich I reverted to butter and both my husband and I preferred the buttery taste. Congratulations on being the number one recipe for so long! 

Roxygirl in Colo."
37449,108522,2005-12-04,5,"I am tickled to be the 100th reviewer of this simple, yet very yummy sandwich! The mayo makes the difference!"
140132,108522,2007-04-15,4,I made this for lunch one day and my DS thought I was crazy for putting the mayo on the outside...lol.  But when he tasted it he loved it.  We will do this again as it made a very beautifully golden sandwich that tasted just as good as it looked....Stephanie
369715,108522,2009-02-23,4,"I made these tonight for dinner and no one even noticed I used mayo instead of butter. I followed the recipe as written other then I used 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich. I loved how the mayo was easier to spread then butter is. I thought these got darker quicker then when I use butter so next time I would watch them a bit closer as they were a bit dark for me. I just like them lightly toasted. I did think they were crispier then a regular grilled cheese, which I really liked. I will be making these again! Thanks for the recipe."
305531,108522,2010-04-28,5,"Yum! Not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said, lol. This was great! Simple, fast, true comfort. Thanks Dawnab. Made for I Recommend Tag."
173579,32614,2005-12-06,4,These were just ok.  I'm going to try them with some other cake mixes.  Thanks for posting.
89831,32614,2005-12-13,5,"The first time I made these I made them with regular chocolate cake mix, they were just okay, but lacking in flavor, I didn't want to rate them making them with a different ingredient, I wanted to wait until I made them with a Devil's Food mix. I just made them again with a Devil's food cake mix, I reduced the oil a bit and added in mini chocolate chips, and WOW what an extreme difference! For a cookie recipe with only 3 ingredients, I am impressed, and I will make them again, thanks for posting this super-easy cookie recipe Karen!....Kitten:)"
296809,32614,2006-10-23,5,"Awesome cookie for both their easy fix & great taste. I didn't make them myself, but I did have the pleasure of eating them here in Dallas where DH & I are visiting SusieQusie. I begged her not to make them because I knew we would not be able to resist them. I was so right, but was glad she ignored me! They are great & will be in our X-Mas gift baskets to DH's family in Iceland. Thx for sharing this recipe w/all of us. Yum!"
324390,32614,2007-02-16,5,I just found out I needed to attend a DESSERT pot luck tonight! I needed something quick and these were so quick I have time to write the review. These have a nice flavor and I'm sure will be a hit tonight. Thanks Karen!
140132,32614,2008-01-20,5,"My mom used to make these.  I don't know if this is her same recipe, but these taste just like them.  Thank you for the recipe that I can share with my kids....Stephanie"
560491,32614,2011-08-19,5,"So good and rich!  I made as written and didn't have a problem with the powdered sugar disappearing (followed the notes).  Will make again, these are a great cookie to have for last minute dessert.  Made for All You Can Cook Buffet."
158086,34382,2007-11-26,5,made these for thanksgiving and they ate them all up....so I am assuming that they were a hit!
8688,34382,2003-04-01,5,"Inez, I never tried making red potatoes into mashed before, and I am so glad I finally did!  Your recipe is wonderful, and so are you, my dear!  So easy to prepare and so tasty to boot! Dan gives you two thumbs up!! ;).  Thanks, once again, Nezz, for appearing once again with a wonderful dish for our table!"
95743,34382,2003-11-25,5,Delicous and much simpler to make than some other mashed garlic-potato recipes. Skipped the butter and didn't miss it a bit. Doubled the garlic.
37449,34382,2004-11-06,5,"I was going to make these exactly as stated, but at the last minute my DH told me he hates cheese in his mashed potatoes, so I left out the parmesan cheese, but it was great without it. Thanks Inez. I will make it with the cheese sometime just for me."
140132,34382,2007-04-13,5,"Oh wow!!!  I have just recently been introduced to garlic mashed potatoes and I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to the original...lol. I saw your recipe and liked the idea of the parmesan cheese with the garlic.  I was right, it was delicious, even DH who doesn't like parmesan cheese had seconds of this.  This is really very good and I will use this recipe over and over again....thank you.....Stephanie"
53932,34382,2008-12-13,5,Very good.  I used more garlic and parmesan because I love both.
173579,34382,2011-04-06,5,These were fantastic!  Thanks for posting.
176615,34382,2014-07-16,5,"Very tasty and really easy, too! I added a little extra milk. Garlic flavor is not strong, so could add more if desired. We enjoyed it as is. Thanks for the recipe!"
166642,30366,2007-04-03,4,This is a good basic macaroni and cheese recipe. I enjoyed it because it is not too cheesy and you don't have that floury taste like a lot of mac and cheese recipes. I do think the butter should be increased to 4 T because it was difficult to get the flour mixture smooth.
126440,30366,2011-11-20,5,Loved the creaminess and the flavors.  I had 8 oz. of Tillamook garlic white cheddar to try and just loved it.  Faint flavor of garlic that we loved.
53932,30366,2007-12-12,5,This is the perfect comfort food.  I used an extra sharp cheddar and thought that provided a really nice flavor.  The sauce was creamy and well seasoned.  I did sprinkle some mozzarella on top as I didn't leave enough cheddar but that was a great addition.
140132,30366,2008-01-17,5,cheesy creamy goodness....what more could you ask for....thanks it was delicious....STephanie
47892,30366,2008-05-07,5,"Original review 18 Feb 08: I had one person to impress with this recipe: a very picky 9 year old boy. He went back for thirds. As long as he was happy, that's all that mattered. My work is finished. (I added bread crumbs to the top because I love bread crumbs on my mac 'n' cheese.) Prepped the casserole one day in advance although I don't think next time I would do that. For quicker preparation a food processor was very handy for grating the cheese because I doubled the recipe. Thanks for posting. cg Update, after reading through some of the reviews again I found it necessary to say that if you use a whisk to stir the flour and milk together it will break up any lumps. Use a whisk also to stir the cheese into the milk. I forgot to mention in my initial review that I decreased the salt by half, used white pepper instead of black, added a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the milk/cheese mixture (because that's what my Mom did.) Use a sharp cheese. What else? As close to my Mom's macaroni and cheese that I have no doubt they are the same recipe. thanks"
133174,30366,2011-06-09,5,Easy and oh so delicious.  This was made gluten free by using gluten free flour and rice pasta.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  There were no leftovers. It is easy to see why the recipe have so many wonderful reviews.
39835,30366,2012-11-04,4,Very good even with the whole wheat pasta I used. next time I will use a bit extra cheese though. Thanks for sharing!
39835,108775,2008-01-12,5,Delicious salmon - I cut down on the honey a bit with wonderful results. We served this with baked potatoes and a tossed salad for a super easy and delicious supper! Thanks for sharing this keeper!
56003,108775,2008-04-10,5,"Oh, we're going to have this again!  I understand completely why is was named baklava salmon.  And, yet, it wasn't overly sweet.  Balance was just right."
158086,108775,2008-08-07,5,"I have never been a big fan of salmon, though I love every other fish...so I thought I would give this recipe a try and went and bought some....we loved it!...I will be making this alot now that
I have found a recipe that we both like...thanks..."
80353,108775,2008-10-10,5,"We all loved it!  Just printed out 15 copies of this recipe to give the moms at Brownies tomorrow.  The textural and flavour contrasts are wonderful - with the crunchy nuts and crumbs, the piquant mustard and the sweetness of the honey.  I think next time I'll add a little garlic powder as well (just a touch!) for added savouriness."
169969,108775,2009-03-14,5,We loved this dish!!!!! It was quick and easy and I would consider it a crowd pleaser. I will be making this recipe again.
305531,108775,2009-09-03,5,Very good salmon. This was easy to prepare and tasted great. Thanks TigerJo. Made for Cookbook Tag.
140132,108775,2010-10-27,5,"I cut this down for 1 person,as my family is out of town.  Oh my goodness, this is delicious.  I loved the mustard flavor mixed with the sweetness of the honey and the nuts and breadcrumbs.  This is so good, I can't wait for the next time I make this.  Thank you for sharing this very good recipe."
173579,108775,2011-04-17,5,Great recipe.  Loved the nut topping.  Thanks for posting.
1179225,108775,2011-12-30,5,"Super good, considering DH and I don't care for salmon. We were given some high quality salmon from a friend who just came back from Alaska. Its such a healthy food and DH and I have really wanted to learn to like it. Your recipe is the closest we've come to loving salmon. Thanks for posting!"
482376,108775,2012-01-27,5,"YUM! What a delicious combination of flavors and textures. The mustard (I used a coarse country dijon), honey and walnuts were sooooooo good with the salmon. Directions for cooking were perfect. The only change I will make next time is to decrease the breadcrumbs  to 1/8 cup and increase the chopped walnuts to 1/2 cup. Thanks for a keeper! I'm putting this recipe into my best of the best file. :)"
226863,108775,2012-02-23,5,"So good!  I halved the recipe with no problems.  I think I might like a little more mustard mixture next time...some of my bread crumbs didn't absorb the flavors.  This is just delicious, and I'll enjoy this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!"
158086,31128,2005-10-23,5,Oh My! I thought I made the best apple pie....this one blows mine right out of the water.....It is a combo of a pie and crisp...wonderful...I am making this for Thanksgiving...I used Splendra and just drizzled a Tablespoon of carmel on top as we have diabetics here and it was perfect...just enouph sweetness...great recipe...
173579,31128,2008-08-31,5,The best tasting pie you will ever want to eat.  The caramel topping just made it.  I can see why this recipe has 153 ratings. Fantastic!  Thanks for posting.
126440,31128,2009-09-29,5,"I made this as an apple crisp, no pie shell.  It had great reviews from family.  Will make this many times."
1072593,31128,2009-10-04,5,A pie that will make 'your' grandma jealous!  Made for An Apple A Day Tag.
140132,31128,2009-10-28,5,Heaven!  This has to be one of the best pies I have made.  I made this last night for our guests and we all loved it.  I especially loved the topping with the apples.....yummy.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.
560491,31128,2010-11-28,5,This pie is sooo good!  I made it for Thanksgiving and this have been voted our new pie to have every year!  I made with gala apples that I peeled and thinly sliced.  I didn't put the pecans on because DH doesn't like them.  Will be making this again!!
204024,31128,2012-11-12,5,This is an excellent pie.  I made this for our church Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit.  Made for I Recommend Tag.
88099,104086,2008-01-18,5,I made this soup exactly as written and we loved it.  So full of flavor with a good kick to it. I simmered mine on the stovetop for most of the day adding extra broth as needed.  For the last few hours I covered it.  Very rich flavored soup.  I used all the garnishes except extra cilantro.  Thanks so much for a wonderful soup recipe.
140132,104086,2009-06-03,4,"I made this last night for supper.  It is very good.  I liked this better then some other soups I've tried like this.  I served it with tortilla chips, avacado, sour cream and cheddar cheese.  So good.  lthank you for sharing your recipe with us."
126440,104086,2013-02-06,5,"Good and spicy, we loved it.  Served with quesadillas.YUM."
133174,74629,2004-07-05,5,"I have often cooked lentils and served it over brown rice.  This was an excellent one dish meal.  Just the right blending of spices.  Cooked exactly in the time given, just the right amount of liquid.  Something I am sure I will make many times over.  Served it with steamed brocolli and your fast soda bread.  "
176615,74629,2006-11-11,5,"For something so simple, this was really good and made a very healthy dinner. I did add more garlic than called for and added salt at serving. Good stock is important, so I'd suggest using homemade. I love the other suggestions of adding carrots or tomatoes to change things up a bit, but found it quite tasty as is with some reduced-fat cheese on top. Thanks, Jen, for sharing a healthy and economical recipe!"
5060,74629,2007-09-27,5,"wow!this has become our favourite casserole side dish! Delicious! I only had 2.5 cups of chicken broth so I added 1/2 cup of the water in a can of mushrooms to make up the 3 cups and ended up adding the mushrooms too, sooo good! Did every thing else as the recipe said.  The cook time was right on, turned out perfect and I will be making this again and often throughout the fall and winter.  Thanks for posting!"
140132,74629,2009-03-27,4,Who would of thought healthy was yummy....lol.   That is what my 6 year old said.  I made this and we were pleasantly surprised at how good this was.   I plan on making this often as its very good and great for you.  Thank you for posting.
1179225,74629,2012-11-13,5,"Put me down as another big fan of this dish. As others have mentioned, I wasn't too interested in trying it, because it isn't the most appealing looking dish. I'm so glad I worked past that and gave it a try. I did add diced carrots, used a cup of lentils, 1 t. each of poultry seasoning, Penzy's pasta sprinkle, and garlic powder. I also used a little more cheese. Baked it at 375 for 50 mins covered, and 15 mins uncovered., kept it warm and served it about two hours after I baked it. I was surprised at how  flavorful and satisfying it was. I'm really looking forward to making this again, adding mushrooms, celery and maybe some butternut squash. Thanks so much for sharing this tasty, healthy, flexible and inexpensive recipe."
369715,74629,2013-01-16,4,This was good and easy to put together. I used vegetable broth. After reading the other reviews I decided to not add the italian seasoning. I also used a teaspoon of minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also used 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and sprinkled with some salt. I also used Velveeta shredded cheese. I cooked it at 350 because I was also making meatloaf. It still took an hour and 15 minutes to cook. We liked it.
1072593,74629,2014-04-18,5,"I purchased the same book in the late 80&#039;s and had every intention to make this very recipe.   Funny how there&#039;s so many things I want to cook, but never get around to as time roller blades by.  Anyway, better late than never, plus Brown Rice &amp; Lentil Casserole = Eatable Happiness."
39835,35988,2006-01-29,4,Very good but I also thought it had a bit too much spinach--next time I will cut down the spinach a lot and use more tomatoes instead. Thanks for sharing!
101823,35988,2006-11-02,5,"Wonderful soup.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil instead of the whole tomatoes.  We loved the flavor of this soup and will make it often.  Update 11-2-06:  I prepared this adding some browned and crumbled Italian sausage for an Autumn party.  It was a hit among everyone, but the men really enjoyed the sausage in the soup."
136997,35988,2006-11-28,5,This was delicious and a snap to pull together. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole and I did add a bit of basil and oregano along with some sausage meat. Lovely flavors. :)
222564,35988,2007-02-04,4,"Simple is best! Really easy and tasty soup in no time at all. Cheese tortellinis go well in this recipe. I used only the 4 cups broth but we thought it was little watery, though, and would add some tomato paste next time, to give it little more body. Cheese is must and we use more garlic, too."
160974,35988,2007-05-23,5,"I chose this for our Sunday lunch. I loved how you didn't have to cook the noodles separately, since it really made the cooking go fast. I used 6 cups broth  (including 2 cups water mixed with chicken boullion) and fresh spinach. Served with wheat bread broiled with butter and parmesan. I will keep these ingred. in the pantry for when I need a quick dinner.  Thanks Spatchcock, for posting.

Update: my daughter has requested this recipe again so it's going to be a family favorite.

Roxygirl"
158086,35988,2008-05-19,5,"Loved this soup, it was so simple.  I did add an 8oz. can of tomato sauce as I had a little more chicken broth then the recipe called for...great fast soup recipe."
209747,35988,2010-01-05,5,Easy. Yummy. Nutritious! I used fresh spinach and fresh cheese tortellini. This would be good with some fresh  sliced mushrooms added. I will try that next time. So good on a cold day! Thanks for posting!
126440,35988,2010-10-01,5,"Wonderful soup.  DH said a 10, he loved the tortellini and fresh spinach.  I'm sure he will want this one often."
140132,35988,2010-10-25,5,What a great recipe.  I made this for DH and myself for supper tonight and we really enjoyed this.  I did add a pound of mild italian sausage browned up and used tomato sauce in place of the whole tomatoes (thought I had some but didn't)and I used cheese tortellinis.  We loved the soup and I know my kids will too.  I'm already looking forward to lunch tomorrow for the leftovers.  Thank you for sharing this with us.
386585,35988,2012-01-18,5,"What else can I say that hasn't been said in the 218 previous reviews?  Easy and tasty.  I used a chicken and prosciutto tortellini, which probably added even more flavor.  A keeper!"
8688,35988,2012-02-13,5,"(1/20/2009)This wonderfully flavorful soup can be put together in a matter of minutes.  I made as directed using 6 cups of reduced sodium chicken broth, about 1 cup of chopped onion, 1 (29 0z) can of whole tomatoes and   sausage with cheese fresh tortellini which added a lot of flavor.  This is a great recipe if you have little time to spend preparing supper.  I served with a crispy crust French bread with butter.  Thank you for posting, spatchcock! (Updated 2/13/2012) I continue making this soup.  Now I am using all organic vegetable broth and replacing the tortellini with mini spinach tortellini filled with sun-dried tomato. Super-good!!"
8688,22782,2003-05-08,5,"Sharlene, I remember adding this recipe to my cookbook the day it was published, yet I have only now gotten around to preparing it.  I now can only ask myself, why did it take me so long?  Your years of perfecting this recipe has paid off as this is a superior spaghetti sauce! I had to prepare this while my husband was out of town because he has always told me never to make any spaghetti sauce other than my own.  Once he tastes your recipe, he may change his mind!  I followed your directions to the letter, using 2 pounds of sweet Italian sausage, removing the casings and stirring to crumble. I used Kendall-Jackson Merlot which proved to be a perfect choice for red wine, and my husband's favorite ;). I served over spaghetti with freshly grated parmesan and freshly sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter and a warmed baguette."
95743,22782,2004-02-05,5,Wonderful!  A great sauce that makes enough to put some in the freezer for use later. Surprisingly easy and tasted great with only one hour's simmering. Loved it!!
136997,22782,2004-04-10,5,Just add me to the list of growing praises for this very tasty recipe. The fact that it goes a long way is also a plus. Didn't change a thing. 
158086,22782,2005-02-10,5,"Okay, add me to the list that loved this recipe...i had an old spaghetti sauce recipe that i always made, but thought i would try a different one...this is wonderful....thick and rich...will be making lasagna with the leftovers tonite...yummm"
197023,22782,2005-08-27,5,"Really delicious!  I was making this for “Freeze it!” Tag, so I doubled the recipe and have now also reheated some of what had been frozen.  Because I don’t like spiciness in cooking, I omitted the crushed red pepper flakes, but apart from using 1 kilo of top quality ground beef and 1 kilo of Italian mild sausage (1 kilo is about 2.2 pounds), increasing the garlic, and adding about 500 grams (1 pound) of mushrooms, I followed the recipe exactly.  Sharlene~W’s instructions were really easy to follow, the spaghetti sauce smelt wonderful while it was cooking, and everyone just LOVED it!  I served it with angel hair pasta.  Freezing is simple.  I transferred meal size portions to Tupperware Rock ‘N Serve containers, and allowed them to cool before putting them in the freezer.  When required, I allowed the spaghetti sauce to thaw overnight at room temperature.  The sauce and pasta can be reheated slowly in a low oven in an ovenproof dish covered with foil, or in a suitable dish in the microwave.  As reviewer 208, I thoroughly recommend this recipe.  If you haven't yet tried it, and you love tomato-based pasta sauces, try it!"
53932,22782,2005-11-05,5,I was skeptical because I really like my own sauce and not many others.  This was very good.  I used 1 pound of sausage and only 24 oz of tomato sauce.  I didn't add as much water as called for--perhaps 1/4 cup.  The resulting sauce was nice and thick.  I would add less red pepper next time as it was a bit too spicy (I used a bit less than 1/4 tsp).  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
280271,22782,2006-01-15,5,With 237 high reviews why bother with another? Because it is that good! DH said it's the best he has ever tried. He rates everything I  cook. This was a 10. I have to agree with him. Today I'm making the lasagna for tomorrow's dinner. A must make. Enjoy!
176615,22782,2006-02-07,5,"Delicious! Everyone in the family enjoyed this sauce. I simmered for several hours and added a touch more water toward the end. Froze part of the batch which will be much appreciated on a busy night. Don't know what I can add to so many reviews except that I made this as stated and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks, Sharlene, for a fabulous dinner!"
424680,22782,2007-01-25,5,"As with most recipes I make, I followed the directions exactly & the result is OUTSTANDING, absolutely great, & I doubt that I'll ever go back to store-bought sauce again! However, I might thicken it a little next time, & perhaps add more wine, but even if I didn't, it would be very satisfying! I'm even thinking of topping off a plain cheese pizza with it! Thanks so much!"
140132,22782,2007-11-05,4,This was good.  My DD loves spaghetti and was asking for it.  I found your recipe and thought it must be good.  We weren't dissappointed.  The red wine takes this over the top....delicious.  Thank you for this great recipe....STephanie
305531,22782,2008-09-02,5,Great spaghetti sauce! I followed the recipe as written and used hot Italian sausage. The wine really added a nice depth to the sauce. Thanks Sharlene for a keeper. Made for I Recommend tag.
166642,22782,2011-01-11,5,"This is a delicious sauce recipe! It is so simple and full of flavor. I let mine simmer all day long until dinner time. My family loved it. I used 1 pound of hot Italian sausage and I made ""Recipe#92095"", too, and just dropped the meatballs in the sauce to cook. A great meal and I will freeze the leftover sauce to enjoy another time. I will probably be trying your lasagna next! Thanks for sharing."
400708,22782,2011-07-05,5,"With 940 reviews and 40 photos you really don't need any more but this was so good I have to put in my comments.  I made this as directed except for a few minor change, I used a mixture of both sausage and hamburger meat and instead of cooking on the stove top I browned the meat, onions and garlic then dumped it all in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours.  The end result was soooo good, truly ""world famous"" and this is how I'll be doing spaghetti from now on.  The flavors are awesome and just the right amount of kick with the red pepper flakes.  The one problem I had is I didn't see wine listed in the ingrediants so wasn't sure how much to add so I just added 3/4 cup and it came out great.  With the left over sauce, I froze and will be eager to use again when DH gets hungry.  Served with recipe#404470 and the last of the Washington red wine I added to the spaghetti - what a great dinner."
383346,22782,2013-07-10,5,This spaghetti sauce is so good.  I used spicy italian sausages and merlot red wine.  Thanks Sharlene :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game
226863,22782,2013-07-12,5,"Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 italian sausage and 1/2 ground chuck.  Drained the fat off before adding the onions.  I kept reading over the recipe looking for the oregano...LOL.  I made it exactly as posted and we really enjoyed it.  Didn&#039;t miss the oregano at all.  I did add a splash more wine.  I simmered for 4 hours....its even better the next day.  Thanks for sharing!"
653438,22782,2013-07-28,5,Another great review!!!  I made half of this recipe using ground beef and Italian turkey sausage less water and followed the rest of the ingredients.  DH was in heaven!  We had enough left over for another meal.  Definately a keeper.  I did cook the sauce on low also for 4 1/2 to 5 hours served over spaghetti and served with a green salad (with Italian dressing) and garlic bread.  Thank you for posting the recipe.
88099,22782,2018-08-24,3,This was just okay for us. I thought it needed more seasoning. As other reviewers recommended I used one pound of Italian Sausage and one pound of hamburger meat. Than ks for sharing.
8688,87925,2005-06-15,5,"EXTREME was definitely the right name for this brownie!  Pure decadent chocolate fudgey flavor through and through : ) If you don't have an occassion to made this recipe, invent one, QUICK! This is an easy recipe with superior results!  I did notice adding the flour, salt and baking soda was missing from the steps; I added them after mixing in the chocolate in step #5, only until blended.  Don't forget to add in the second batch of 2 cups of chocolate chips!! I also added in about 1 ½ cups of well chopped walnuts. Kittencal, you out did yourself on this recipe : )  Thank you, thank you, thank you : )"
222564,87925,2006-08-15,5,Simply to die for!
166642,87925,2008-02-19,5,"Extreme chocolate brownies is the perfect name for this recipe. They are so yummy and fudgy. My boys, who LOVE brownies, just thought these were one of the best I've ever made. I used the full amount of sugar and that was just great for us. A small piece goes a long way! Thanks for sharing another winner, Kitten."
67656,87925,2008-03-17,5,"Made these as a birthday gift for a chocolate loving friend.  Not a cake but he was thrilled to pieces commenting ""can't get anything that good out of a box.""  They were a cinch to make and my half batch was baked in about 32 minutes.  I did chill over night which only added to their divine texture and taste.  Thanks Kitten."
461834,87925,2008-10-13,5,"These are definitely extreme chocolate brownies as the name says!!!  I made this as written, but cut the recipe in half and used the lesser sugar option.  These are so rich, I can only eat a very small piece at a time, but so good!!!  Thanks for sharing Kit!!  Made for zaar stars tag."
226863,87925,2009-03-02,5,"I made these for my son last night, and they are amazing!  Another Kittencal winner.  This is a chocolate lovers dream.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe! I made this for Zaar Stars Tag."
140132,87925,2009-09-24,5,"OMG....you should rename these ""A slice of heaven"" !!!  These are so good.  Thank you thank you thank you for sharing this gooey chewey browning recipe with us.  We will most definately make these again....and again....and again."
8688,53914,2004-03-25,5,"This dish was excellent!  Very easy to prepare and the taste was superb!  I loved the topping which gave the fish such a wonderful flavor, yet did not overpower the fish.  I offered extra lemon slices at the table and also served with a broccoli casserole and homemade bread.  This recipe will go into my permanent cookbook file!  Thank you so much, Crabbycakes, for sharing this with us!"
88099,53914,2004-07-04,5,"Crabbycakes, you probably don't need another 5 star, but I had to put my 2 cents worth in.  This was absolutely wonderful.  I followed the directions to the letter, but did broil the fish the last few minutes to brown the cheese sause at the end.  I have had trouble with my appitite lately and this is the first thing that has actually tasted good to me in a couple of months.  I actually ate 3 whole pieces of the fish.  Thanks for a great recipe."
37449,53914,2004-08-04,5,I picked this for the I Recommend this Recipe game and I'm so glad I did! This was delicious! I halved the recipe with no problem. I broiled the fish too and the topping came out nice and browned. Thanks Crabbycakes!
173579,53914,2005-01-26,5,This recipe is great!  It has so much flavor.  Very simple and easy to make.  Couldn't go to a restaurant and get any better!  I will be making this from now on.  Thanks for posting.
53932,53914,2005-09-16,5,"What can I add that hasn't been written?  This was really, really good.  I halved the butter and doubled the Old Bay Seasoning.  I only baked my thin fillets for about half the time suggested and they were perfectly done.  Garlic would be a nice addition and I will try that next time.  Thank you for sharing the recipe."
176615,53914,2006-03-22,5,"Fantastic! Used reduced-fat Hellman's mayo which worked well. Otherwise, made as directed, modifying the cooking time a bit since my filets were thin. A nice change from the blackened fish I usually eat. Will definitely make again! Thnaks, Crabbycakes, for sharing the recipe!"
280271,53914,2006-11-06,5,"DH took one bite and said ""this is really good""!! It all went together with ease and the flavor was just out of this world. The whole dish melted in your mouth. I will be preparing this dish quite often. Thanks, Crabbycakes for posting this delicious dish."
140132,53914,2007-02-01,5,"I have made this two times now and we absolutely love this recipe.  Even hubby who isn't a fan of parmesan cheese.  I used orange roughy the first time and tilapia the second, both are delicious. This is a great fish recipe, a nice change from just plain baked fish......Stephanie"
56003,53914,2007-11-10,5,"This is a recipe that I can make again and again, and not get tired of eating it.  Very easy, very quick, and tastes great.  Can't say anything else that hasn't already been said.  Thanks again, Crabbycakes, for wonderful recipe."
386585,53914,2008-07-29,5,"Truly excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except for the cooking process.  I baked the fish at 350 for 20 minutes, then spread the parmesan topping on it, and ran it under the broiler on low for about 5 minutes.  I will definitely be making this one again!"
400708,53914,2012-06-28,5,Lovely light tilapia and easy to fix.  Next time think I'll do it in the broiler to get that toasty brown color without over cooking the fish.  I liked others idea about adding some lemon zest to the top too but still wonderful as I made it.  Enjoyed this wonderful blend of flavors without over powering the tilapia itself.
136997,53914,2012-06-05,5,Scaled the recipe back to serve two. Omitted the hot sauce and added the lemon zest along with the juice. Don't like wasting expensive lemons. Delicious. :)
39835,53914,2014-02-01,5,Delicious! I used the tilapia and the rest of the ingredients as listed but subbed oregano for the basil. Served with broiled tomatoes and grapes.
41578,27208,2002-06-17,5,"Today was a cold and rainy day...a perfect day to do a roast.  Yooper's ""To Die For Cockpot Roast"" was excellent!!!  I used a full package of the brown gravy mix and ranch mix and only about half of the italian mix.  I did not use all of the mix...just enough to give the roast a good coating.  I will make this roast again and again and again.  Thank you Yooper for a great recipe!"
29196,27208,2002-10-19,4,"This was good. Rich and tasty and we all quite enjoyed it. I read ALL the reviews and thoroughly confused myself as to how much of which packet to use, how much water to add, how long to cook the meat (a 1.8kg blade roast) and what to do with the remaining juice.
I used all the packets (so I think it was a little too salty for us). I used a cup of water (just right I think), I cooked it for 9 hours on low (so I think it was a little overdone) and I thickened the remaining juice with a little corn flour."
17803,27208,2002-10-20,5,I also thought the flavor combination was excellent.  The next time I make this I want to add another packet of gravy.  Then divide the mixture in half and save half for another day.  I'll be e-mailing this recipe to family and friends.  
37449,27208,2002-11-11,5,"I used a bone-in chuck roast, cut the ranch dressing in 1/2, did add 1/4 cup more water. My husband said,"" Don't you dare not cook this roast again!"" Served it with whole wheat bread to sop up the juices and rice-broccoli casserole! Thanks!"
140132,27208,2004-05-07,5,"Simple and delicious, what could be better then that?  We loved this and will make again and again.  The roast turned out perfect, not mushy or dry, it was moist and sliced perfectly. I didn't add any veggies but will try it the next time. I can't wait for the next time and we just finished the first one!!lol"
128473,27208,2005-03-20,5,"Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe Yooper. I used a 3.5 lb blade roast and sprinkled half of the italian and ranch mixes over the roast.I didn't have any brown gravy mix so I mixed 1/4 cup of beef bovril with water. When the roast was almost cooked, I made a thick gravy then placed the roast into the pot with the simmering gravy. We really enjoyed this tender and spicy dish."
173579,27208,2005-03-29,5,This is a very good tasting pot roast.  Quick and easy.  Very tender and also excellent gravy.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
88099,27208,2005-04-06,3,"This was good, but not great.  My roast was dry, I cooked it exactly 7 hours.  The flavor wasn't all that great, even though I added a small sliced onion and carrots to the mix, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I'll stay with my other roast recipes."
8688,27208,2006-01-11,5,"I wish I had bought a larger chuck roast! The taste of this Pot Roast is absolutely fabulous! A meal fit for a queen (...or king)! The seasonings were perfect and it is so incredibly moist it falls apart with your fork!! I wouldn't change one single thing, except next time I may invite company over to share! This one is a definate keeper. Thank you so much, yooper, for sharing this recipe with your 'Zaar buddies! You done (really, really) good. ;) -- posted Jul 8, 2002
Just an update to let you know I am still serving this wonderfully easy and delicious pot roast! This morning, I was in the midst of putting all the ingredients in the crockpot, when lo and behold, I discovered I had no Ranch dressing!  Needing an immediate alternative, I subbed a package of Knorr's French Onion Soup mix.  A decision that proved to be an excellent choice!  I increased the water to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 red wine.  I did add some sliced carrotts and potatoes a couple hours before the roast was done.  Thanks again, and again, Yooper, for sharing!"
158086,27208,2006-03-31,5,I just bought myself a new crockpot...have not had one in years...this was a great recipe to try it out on...it was so nice to come home from work and have dinner done...we loved it...it was alittle on the salty side..but we did not care...
136997,27208,2006-11-20,4,This came out so very tender with lots of gravy juices. My daughter asked if she could take the leftovers back to college with her. I used salt reduced italien/gravy mix and half a packet of ranch. Nice flavor. :)
369715,27208,2008-02-11,4,This was good and easy to throw together in the morning. I cooked mine for 6 hours and it was done perfect. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Good recipe using ingredients that I normally have on hand.
226863,27208,2009-03-11,5,"Because of the comments about saltiness, I wanted to reduce my mix ingredients.  All of my packages of mixes were less than the 1 1/4 oz amount, so I just used one of each....most were around 0.8 oz.  This was very good, and my DS has asked that I make it again.  So this will be going in the keeper file!  Made for All New Zaar Cookbook Tag Game."
305531,27208,2011-08-06,5,I've made this roast for years but just discovered that I had never reviewed it before. This is a great recipe and our favorite way to have roast. Thanks yooper for sharing the recipe. Made for All You Can Cook Buffet special.
128473,145038,2006-03-22,5,"Thank you so much for sharing djmastermum. My dh loved the chicken legs prepared this way.
This easy to make recipe tasted amazing, we loved the flavour of the soya sauce, honey and garlic.  Absolutely delicious served with mashed potatoes and peas."
17803,145038,2008-03-14,4,"This recipe had easy to follow instructions, simple to make and it has a good flavor.  I lined my pan with foil for easy cleanup.  I also baked my wings for about 20 minutes longer.  This recipe was  Recipenapped and made for the *Recipe Swap 14* game 2008 in the Aussie/NZ forum. Our group was *The Kumara Kids* Group 28"
140132,145038,2009-03-24,5,"I made these for lunch for me and my kids.  We enjoyed these very much.  I used wings and served with homemade potato chips, delicious meal.  Thank you so much for posting this yummy way to make wings."
286566,145038,2010-12-09,5,"I used chicken wings (1 oz short of 5 lbs worth - 18 wings in total including tips - ) so I upped the sauce as follows taking into account dietary needs - 3 1/3 T olive oil, 3/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium), 3 1/3 T tomatoe sauce (ketchup). 1/2 cup honey and 5 teaspoons of minced garlic.  I poured this over the wings and let them marinate for a few hours and cooked as directed (they were well crowded in the pan) and baked them for 1 hour at 175C fan forced oven and turned them over about half way through the cooking time.  Delicious with the sauce drizzled over the rice and steamed vegetables.  Of the 18 cooked we ended up with 5 left over and it is a bun fight between the DM and me as to who gets them for lunch tomorrow - so maybe if will have to be a snack for each of us.  Thank you djmastermum for a great recipe (which I will be trying with a quartered chicken) , made for Aussie/Kiwi Swap #37 February 2010."
176615,145038,2012-10-22,5,"Really good and super easy! For 10 legs and 2 thighs I used 1 1/2 recipes of sauce mixture and baked in my nonstick roasting pan, basting a couple of times while cooking and after I took out of the oven. Baked at 350 for an hour. Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
204024,145038,2013-06-16,5,"Easy, quick and delicious. We used wings.  Made for Name that Ingredient."
222564,63071,2006-07-16,4,"Very good, easy and light waffle! I should probably have left them longer in the waffle iron to get really good brown color, as instructed, because mine were not crispy outside, as I would have liked them to be. Great with jam and cream, anyway."
8688,63071,2007-02-21,5,"These little guys are great, Marie!  Nice and fluffy on the inside and brown and crisp beautifully in my Belgian Waffle machine.  I scaled this down to 2 servings and had them for supper while going it solo for the evening. I served them with Recipe #196016 for a real treat! Thanks for keeping me company, Marie!"
280271,63071,2013-01-13,5,I have given a few recipes on this site a try...hubby bought a professional waffle maker...I guess he likes waffles...anyway...this is awesome...I have made it at least a dozen times now...still trying to prefect the amount needed for my maker...either liquid spills out...or I have cute little ends...but the taste never varies...and here is someone who can't get egg whites to whip...but I can now...thanks for posting this delicious recipe...:)
560491,63071,2013-10-03,5,Great waffles!  They were nice and crispy Ono the outside and fluffy inside.  I made 1/2 the recipe and got 3 large waffles.  Made for Tagging Mania Tag.
400708,63071,2013-12-27,5,"My DGD was visiting and requested Chocolate Chip Waffles for breakfast so I was on a search for one that was good, quick and easy and chose this one.  WIN for me.  It had it all, a nice crusty outside with a fluffy soft center.  I only added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the mix (we love vanilla) and then when we placed it on the griddle added a sprinkling of chips to hers.  Then when done gave her a choose of syrup or whipped cream (she choose whipped cream of course) and it fit everyone of both her&#039;s &amp; my requirements.  Taste was spot on, loved that you whip the egg whites, made for a light and fluffy waffle."
126440,63071,2014-03-09,5,WOW best waffles that I have ever made.  Got 20 waffles so have lots leftover for breakfast this week.  Made a berry syrup to go with them and served with sausage patties.
128473,63071,2015-04-17,5,"Wow, 5 stars all the way Marie.  These wonderful little treats were indeed  super crisp on the outside and light as a feather inside and so scrumptious! They were so quick and easy to make.  Great flavor and excellent texture. I enjoyed them very much.  Garnished mine with a little icing  sugar for a delicious meal.  Made for What&#039;s on the Menu? Tag Game 2015."
89831,40497,2004-08-10,5,"Delicious! I made as directed, and doubled the recipe, they were just wonderful with a side salad and homemade fries...thank you for sharing Marie, I will be making these again soon!....Kittencal:)"
173579,40497,2010-02-17,5,This is a marvelous oven chicken wings recipe.  They are so flavorful.  Will be making these from now on.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
305531,40497,2010-08-18,5,These were simple and tasty. I was feeling lazy and didn't clip the wings. We ate these as an appetizer and they were really enjoyed. Thanks Marie for sharing the recipe. Made for Cookbook Tag.
286566,40497,2011-03-03,5,"These were good and full of flavour though not as crispy as hoped but that may have been my fault - I only cut the wing off and left the the rest intact and baked as per instructions but allowed 40 to 45 minutes, the reason I think mine did not come out crispy as they were to well crammed in the pan - I had 12 wings and the weight (before cutting off tips was about 1.8K (just under 4lb) but I wanted some left over as we like to snack on them cold, so that said I would spread them over 2 pans and then I think they would crisp up beautifully.  Also I melted my butter in a jug in the microwave and poured into the lined baking dish.  Thank you Marie, made for I Recommend tag game and recommended by lazyme."
140132,40497,2011-09-26,5,We made these for our game day party and we loved them.  I wanted wings but didn't feel like standing there frying them.  These were perfect.  They had great taste from the seasonings and they looked like they were fried without all the extra grease.  Thank you for sharing this with us.
128473,40497,2015-03-02,5,"Wow, wow, wow.  We really enjoyed the chicken wings prepared this way.  So quick and easy to make.  So delicious.  They were perfectly cooked, tender and juicy with a crisp outer skin, spiced perfectly.  Thanks so much for sharing a recipe that I will make again and again.  Made for Whats on the Menu? Tag Game 2015."
226863,40497,2016-02-09,5,I have another favorite chicken wing recipe!  Mine turned out perfectly crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  Tossed with some Frank&#039;s Red Hot sauce mixed with a bit of butter.  Great super bowl food!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Favorites of 2015 tag game.
280271,40497,2017-02-07,5,OMG! I know this doesn't need another review...but dang!...this makes a great crispy wing...I cooked it as posted and didn't add a sauce...although I will next time...the hardest part of the recipe is making sure the wings are dry...I can't tell you how many paper towels I went through...Made this for the Best of 2016 tag game...Yum!!!
89831,29598,2005-07-21,5,"GinnyP, I just couldn't wait to rate this wonderful marinade recipe! I used this marinade for chicken breasts, marinated them early in the morning and grilled them today. I added about 1 heaping tablespoon of minced fresh garlic in with the marinade, and increased the mustard slightly. The chicken breasts were so tender, and without an overpowering taste, just perfect flavor!! I'll use this again...Kittencal:)"
53932,29598,2005-07-23,4,"This produced very moist chicken, but was a bit too sweet for me.  I thought the acids would balance the sweetness but not so.  Next time, I would just add 1/4 of the sugar and add more garlic."
222564,29598,2005-10-29,4,"Great recipe for grilling skinles chicken bits! Did no one else find it a little dry? Must have been the chicken. Will try again, the marinade was so good."
140132,29598,2007-01-26,5,"We loved this very versitile recipe.  I was craving a summer style meal and made this was chicken breasts, potato salad and beans....yummy.  Thank you for my little taste of summer in the winter.....Stephanie"
158086,29598,2007-08-12,5,This was very good marinade...the chicken stayed nice and moist...though I do think I like my tarragon marinade a little more...
1072593,29598,2010-12-10,5,"Amazing Chicken Marinade...so, this is what my life's been missing!  Made for P-A-R-T-Y tag."
204024,29598,2013-06-25,5,"Loved this marinade.  We used boneless, skinless, thighs.  Defiinitely will be making this again.   Made for Name that Ingredient."
560491,29598,2014-05-21,5,The name says it all; this is AMAZING!  Made as written and marinated b/s chicken breasts for 10 hours and then grilled.  It is the perfect balance of sweet and tang!  DH loves grilled chicken but ooh&#039;d and ahh&#039;d throughout the entire meal.  Going into my Best of 2014 Cookbook.  Made for Name that Ingredient Tag.
452940,2886,2008-09-22,5,Great banana bread. We enjoy warming slices in a skillet with butter. Yummy!
560491,2886,2009-03-20,5,This is the best banana bread I have had!!!  This is one of the first recipes I tried when I found recipezaar and have been making it almost every month!!  I chose this one to try because there were HUNDREDS of positive reviews!!  I have not tried making loaves but can make 2 doz mini muffins in 14 mins or 18 regular sized muffins in 17 mins; I am able to make a batch in the morning befor DH goes to work.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!
383346,2886,2010-12-07,5,This is one of the best banana bread I made.  It's very moist and the taste is amazing.  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar.  I baked it 20 minutes more.  Thanks ikadlec :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
482376,2886,2011-04-12,4,I loved how high this banana bread rose. It was very moist and the banana flavor was nice and strong. I would probably eliminate one banana next time so the bread wouldn't be as moist. I like mine a little bit drier (personal preference). Thanks!
8688,2886,2012-11-03,5,I have to agree with the other 439 reviewers - This is the Perfect Banana Bread.  Not too sweet with the proper balance of banana to flour to make the best texture.  I did add 1 cup of well chopped walnuts to this recipe.  This recipe is truly exceptional!
6357,15072,2003-02-20,5,"Yummy!! Loved these, very addicitive, I will have to stay far(trying to and have to knock off a few pounds) :)
My house smelt WONDERFUL while these were baking, and, when these were done, and I opened the door of my oven, mmmmmmmmmmmm, I was in CHOCOLATE PARADISE! Thank You so much for posting an incredibly tasty brownie recipe. I made a whole batch of these on 18th, and took it to my friends' place where their kid sister freaked on these;)
THANKS A BUNCH for making her day and mine:)"
8688,15072,2003-05-07,5,"I have made a lot of brownie recipes, and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest!  So very simple to prepare, using Virginia's excellent instructions.  Even mixing the batter by wooden spoon is simple because you are adding in only portions at a time.  I omitted the nuts as I will be offering these to my son who doesn't like nuts in his brownies (I love them and would have added walnuts - next batch, I will!).  Brownies were ready and baked in exactly 30 minutes.  I will keep this recipe in my Make Again Collection!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us, Virginia!"
89831,15072,2004-01-19,5,"Hi Virginia...I made your brownies today, after reading all the great reviews, I just had to see what all this fuss was about, and now i know...well, what more can I add that has not already been said...these are actually the best brownies that I have ever made...this is what a brownie should taste like...moist, soft, and with a rich chocolate flavor...made them exactly as stated... I added 1 cup chocolate chips, and 2 Tbsp Kahlua (that I had left over from Christmas, with the vanilla)... baked it on the middle rack, so they would not get too over done on the bottom...they turned out wonderful, so good that they really don't even need any frosting, but we my DH and my son love frosting so I will add it on the brownies. Thank you so much for posting such a wonderful recipe, I will be making these again very soon. :-)"
101823,15072,2005-03-19,4,"These were good chocolate brownies, but lacked the deep fudgy flavor that I had hoped for.  I also found my brownies to be still incredibly gooey in the middle after 30 minutes of baking.  They weren't even properly ""set"" and still wanted to run in the pan.  I popped them back in for about 10 more minutes, which did set them, but still left a much more mushy texture than I like.  I am searching for the perfect gooey, chewy, fudgy brownie.  These are good, but not quite what I wanted."
158086,15072,2007-04-11,5,"great recipe, I used splenda for baking to cut down on the sugar and they were easy and turned out perfect...thanks"
140132,15072,2007-06-22,5,"These were soooo good.  My DD made these for us and we loved them.  I usually just buy the box mix, but will no longer.  This is so much better and moister.  Thank you for a great dessert.....Stephanie"
1179225,15072,2010-04-29,5,Perfect! I added the nuts and a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I also sprayed foil and lined the pan. No stick and they were delicious! Thanks so much for posting.
227978,15072,2012-02-09,2,"I had high hopes for this recipe, given the long list of positive reviews, but this recipe just did not turn out for me.  The brownies were quite flat and dry in the middle, and they lacked much chocolatey-cocoa taste (and I used Girardelli premium cocoa that I've used for all my other brownie recipes with great success, so I don't think it was that).  I thought maybe it was something I had done wrong, so I made it a second time with the same result.  So I don't think I'll be making these brownies again."
176615,15072,2012-03-15,5,Yummy! I used salted butter instead of shortening and forgot to cut down the salt. Next time I'd reduce it to 1/4-1/2 t. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
324390,185445,2010-01-25,5,I wanted something pumpkiny without the typical overwhelming spice. This was it! I liked them even before putting the icing on so I can't imagine how good they'll be tomorrow. Thanks Sara!
176615,185445,2010-12-04,5,"Delicious cookies! Soft and cakey with a delicious penuche frosting (do not omit!). Plenty of frosting for the cookies, used 2 cups powdered sugar for the perfect consistency. Used a silicone basting brush to frost the cookies which was so fast and easy. Thanks for sharing that tip, and thanks for sharing the recipe!"
140132,185445,2012-02-10,5,"OMG these are the best cookies.  I made these for my family this afternoon and we all loved them.  They are such moist and soft cookies, and the penuche glaze was to die for.  Yes the glaze is really sweet but it really make the cookie.  DH came home and said a buddies mom use to make these for them when they were younger as he was grabbing another cookie.  Thank you so much for this awesome cookies."
176615,112683,2008-04-29,5,Yummy! Loved the combination of white chocolate and cranberries. Doubled the recipe and was glad I did. Thanks for sharing!
174096,112683,2009-10-01,5,"Delicious and so quick to whip up!  I think I made mine a touch too big, as I ended up with 30 cookies.  Thanks for sharing!"
140132,112683,2011-01-04,5,We included these cookies in our 2010 holiday trays for family and freinds.  They looked so festive with the dried cranberries and they tasted wonderful.  I couldn't quit nibbling.  Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe with us.
422893,112683,2012-01-01,5,Loved these cookies...they're awesome...I used cherries instead of cranberries and they turned out beautiful...gave as gifts for xmas. Thanks for posting!
47892,76864,2006-12-12,5,Did two proofings. Added 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts to the filling. Baked at 365 degrees for 25 minutes. Used parchment paper in the baking pan. Made a pig of myself. Got a bad tummy ache. Thank you for sharing!  cg ;)
176615,76864,2006-12-25,5,"Hands down, the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made. Dough was perfect, very tender, icing is fantastic. I also use Vietnamese cinnamom which is much more flavorful than the stuff you find at the grocery store and which makes a huge difference in this recipe. Used the bread machine to prepare the dough, formed the rolls, then refrigerated overnight. Let rise and baked in the morning. Everyone loved these!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
226863,76864,2010-01-02,5,"I made these exactly as posted, adding a little flour to the cinnamon filling.  I used Saigan cinnamon for the first time with these....what a wow factor!  I didn't read the reviews before I made them, and wish I had so that I would have let them rise the second time before I cooked them.  These taste just like or better than Cinnabon!  Thanks for sharing!"
140132,76864,2010-05-11,5,"These are wonderful!  We (the kids and I) made these for our Mothers Day breakfast and they were really easy to make.  This is my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and I was very nervous.  They were simple to assemble.  We did add some chopped pecans to the cinnamon sugar mixture.  We had to adjust the bake time from 10 minutes to 17 minutes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Oh yea, we did double the frosting recipe thinking we would need it, we didn't.  There would have been plenty of frosting so next time we will know.  Thank you so much for this delicious roll that my whole family devoured."
107135,38298,2005-12-02,5, itried thisoup at olive garden wow since i dont have one where i live i knew someone on zaar would have it  i used bacon slices and chopped them  and onion and garlic together cooked on low til onion was translucent   then added finely chopped kale  cooked it down then added rest of ingredients
126440,38298,2012-03-14,5,I made half a recipe for the two of us and it was perfect.  I used Bob Evans hot sausage and kale (from bountiful baskets) What a great soup!
296809,38298,2006-03-15,5,"I've never eaten this at Olive Garden, but thx to ""SusieQusie"" - I can add my compliments to the chef. My Icelandic hubby & I were the house guests she mentioned in her review & we did rave about this soup. Her last minute tweak with the lime juice was inspired. Yum!"
173579,38298,2006-03-17,5,This was a very tasty soup.  Next time I will put a few more potatoes and mash them up a little so it will be thicker.  My DS really liked it.  Will be making this again soon.  Thanks for posting.  
95743,38298,2006-04-13,5,"There's a reason for 79 great reviews.  Simple, straight-forward and delicious.  I used evaporated milk rather than cream.  Didn't miss the saturated fat.  I sauteed the onion and garlic before adding the liquids."
88099,38298,2007-01-23,5,This soup is actually better than the OG soup we have here.  I made this for our home study group and we all loved it.  I made exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  Have made it twice since first trying it.  One of my favorite soups now.  Thanks for posting.
386585,38298,2008-01-23,4,"I actually have never had the original soup that this is cloned from, but my son has, and he said this was pretty darn close.  In any event, it was very tasty!"
140132,38298,2008-04-18,4,I have never had the Olive Gardens before but this is fantastic.  My family enjoyed this very much. Thank you for posting Cycle Michael........Stephanie
226863,38298,2008-12-27,4,"I'm sure this was good as published. I really enjoyed it, although I made some changes. I sauteed my onions and garlic in the grease from the bacon (I didn't use bacon bits, just crumbled up two pieces of bacon). This released the flavor of the onions and kept them from having a rubbery texture. I also used homemade chicken stock, so I needed more salt for the finished product. I used a pound and a half of italian sausage, standard packaging at my grocery store! I used kale this time, but next time I will use spinach. The kale was just a little too tough in the cook time allowed. I also topped it off with shredded italian cheeses. Next time I will increase the spinach/kale by half and also increase the potatoes by half. I've never had Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana, but I think this is wonderful. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!"
222564,38298,2010-06-23,5,This is wonderful comfort food!
653438,38298,2011-04-05,5,Very very good.  I followed the directions only using half-n-half and adding some red pepper flakes.  Definately a keeper.  Going into my Favorites of 2011.  Thank you.  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag.
158086,108231,2005-08-21,5,First time I ever made this kind of soup....it turned out to be a 10 star recipe all the way...we all loved it...I can see this is going to be the family favorite from now on..
209747,108231,2005-12-20,5,I used only a splash of olive oil- nonstick pan- to reduce fat. Added some diced fresh carrots and celery and upped the garlic to 6 large cloves and added some cayenne to it- have a cold! grrr I used some homemade broth I had frozen and fresh tomatoes rather than canned. this would be great with one chipotle- would add a hint of smoky flavor. I also added some chopped zuchinni at the end just until soft. Very traditional Mexican. Great recipe- very easy to add or take away to your tastes and still comes out yummy! Thanks so much for sharing! 
140132,108231,2008-06-22,5,Yummy.  We really liked this soup.  I served this with Taco Doritos and my kids couldn't get enough.  I will definetaly make again.  Thank you for posting....delicious.
133174,108231,2012-02-08,5,After a 100  reviews what else is there to say.  The recipe was reduced by half.  I did not have the tomato sauce so I added in a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste for richness.  The corn was fresh frozen.  The soup was garnished with green onions and served with tortilla chips on the side.
101823,66575,2006-04-21,4,"I prepared this very sweet salad for a Community Center event.  I only had green grapes on hand and omitted the optional sugar.  The salad was well received, and I came home with an empty bowl.  I did seem to have a lot of dressing, though and might include more fruit in the future."
140132,66575,2007-01-30,5,"This is a very versitile recipe.  I needed something to add to dinner and found this recipe.  Since it was blizzarding outside I used what fruit I had in the house and it still turned out wonderful. I subbed kiwi chunked up in place of the strawberries and I used 1/4 pt of fresh raspberries in place of the blueberries.  It was terrific.  You are right ,, it is the pudding in the sauce that makes this dish.  I plan on making it many different ways all year long.  Thank you for such a forgiving recipe that has the same results every time.....Stephanie"
461834,66575,2007-04-09,4,"Very quick and tasty fruit salad.  I used a can of mandarin oranges, pineapple tidbits and sliced peaches.  I added fresh red grapes and bananas.  I did drain the canned fruit and saved some of the juice from the oranges to mix with the vanilla pudding. I mixed it all together, except bananas, the night before easter.  Kids especially loved this dish."
176615,66575,2008-03-16,5,"Yummy! Made with ingredients stated, omitting sugar, and added a can of mandarin oranges, drained. Whisked the pudding mix with canned juices, then added paches, pineapple, mandarin oranges, and grapes. Stirred in the strawberries, blueberries, and bananas (used two) just before serving. Makes a lot of sauce, in fact could add a lot more fruit and it would still be good. I don't like fruit with heavy dressings, so the consistency was just right for me. Very pretty, easy, and nice to make especially before lots of summer fruits are in season. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
126440,66575,2010-06-01,5,Great salad which can be used as a dessert too.  Easy to make and loved the sauce.
41578,107997,2005-01-16,5,"Superb!  Because of the other reviews, we also cut back on the pepper flakes because some of the people do not care for spicy/hot seasonings.  This is a great shrimp appetizer that everyone loved and asked for copies of the recipe.  Thanks Chippie."
104295,107997,2005-02-26,5,This was really good.  We used previously frozen shrimp and just heated them a tad.  The sauce was excellent.  Left out the red pepper and used Old Bay as the spice.  Served with chia's baked latkes and it was lovely.  Thanks!
53932,107997,2005-07-29,5,"Great, easy recipe.  I didn't change a thing in this recipe.  It's perfect as is."
140132,107997,2007-12-30,5,"Delicious.  I made this for Christmas EVe and it was enjoyed by all.  We really liked the flavor of these and will use this recipe from now on.....Thanks, STephanie"
95743,107997,2008-01-09,5,Simple and excellent.  We served it over fresh greens.
173579,107997,2009-01-22,5,This was fantastic!  Can't go wrong in trying this.  Thanks for posting.
4470,107997,2009-07-20,5,"All the reviewshave already said it for this recipe - quick easy & TASTY - Can't improve on something this good thanks Chippie for a recipe that will be repeated over &  over again
25 Jan 09 Made & enjoyed again. Didn't have Montreal steak spice so I used a hot spic mixture Mmmm
19 July 09 This time I used Jumbo Prawns so large that you only needed two per serving. Fabulous - Too bad that the photo really didn't capture how good they were - Great recipe"
383346,107997,2013-05-16,5,These shrimps are so yummy.  I cooked plain shrimps for our son and then we cooked these shrimps for me and DH.  We liked them so much.  Montreal steak seasoning is great with the shrimps.  I misread the direction and chopped the garlic so I didn&#039;t have to leave it in the skillet.  DH liked that the garlic was with the shrimps.  The lemon zest and juice was also great in it.  Thanks Chippie :)  Made for Holiday tag game
89831,46877,2004-12-02,5,"Uncle Bill, I wish I could rate these cookies higher than 5 stars, they are simply the best! and when I say simply I mean simply, with only three ingredients you couldn't ask for a better shortbread cookie than these. I used half cake flour and half regular flour. For my second batch I add some mini chocolate chips yummmm! I will never use another shortbread recipe again, so buttery, these things just melt in your mouth! This is a sure thing on my goodie tray for this years Chrismas get together at my home. I am very happy to have found such a wonderful recipe, I will make these again and again! Uncle Bill, Thank you for sharing!....Kitten:) "
5060,46877,2007-12-12,5,"Well what can I say, I guess I'm review #73! These are wonderful melt in you mouth shortbread! I only had red cherries , gonna make some more and buy some green ones, great addition to my holiday freezer stash. That's if I can keep them away from DH, he loves them! Thanks for posting!dec 11/07 It's Christmas time again and time for shortbread, our favourite."
8688,46877,2007-12-22,5,"Great Cookies!!  Extremely simple to make with excellent results!  I used a variety to top my cookies of red maraschino cherries, a little red raspberry jam, Sliced almonds and cashew halves. Melt in your mouth delicious! Lovely presentation and a sure winner for any Christmas tray!  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us, Uncle Bill!"
140132,46877,2009-03-27,4,Melt in your mouth delicious.  I made these for my family one weekend and they loved them.  I just used red cherries but that didn't matter.  I can't wait to add this to my Christmas platters.  They are so delicate and literally melt in your mouth.  Thank you for posting.
126440,46877,2010-02-03,5,"Great Shortbread!  I only made half  and wish I had made the entire recipe.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Wow, what great flavor.  Will be making these often as DH loved them."
173579,46877,2011-01-27,5,Great tasting little cookies.  Very light and airy.  Can't beat a good shortbread cookie.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.
1179225,46877,2018-01-23,5,These turned out so light and delicate. I left out the cherries and added the optional vanilla. I baked one half of the dough recipe plain and the other half I added two bags of chai tea. Both were delicious! Thanks for sharing.
56003,31717,2003-11-05,5,"This was great!  Easy, too!  I did forget to start it in the crock pot and did it on top of the stove Simmered it for about 1 1/2 hours and it was delicious.  I, also, added pre-cooked pasta.  Will definitely have this again this winter for the extended family."
126440,31717,2005-01-04,4,"Made this Sun for dinner.  This is very good.  I used my own spaghetti sauce and cook for about 3 hours on the stove top.  Wonderful, will have left overs tomorrow."
41578,31717,2007-10-06,5,"It was a little warm outside to be making soup, but this sounded so good I had to try it.  I was NOT disappointed.  Don't know if this is like Olive Garden (never had it) but it is a fabulous soup anyway.  Great flavor that makes your tummy go....YUM, YUM.  Thanks for sharing this winner, ravensmith."
173579,31717,2006-07-21,5,My family really did like this soup.  Simple to put together.  Will make this again soon.  Thanks for posting.   
1179225,31717,2009-08-31,5,This was excellent! Loved by all. Looking forward to making this again. Thank you for posting!
140132,31717,2011-01-14,3,"We had a busy night planned with running with the kids so I opted for this recipe so it would be ready for when we all got home.  I started this at 10:00 am and we were ready to eat at 8:00pm, and while it was ok the carrots and celery were still crunchy.  DS liked it more then the rest of us, I hate to be the ""odd man out"" but we just didn't care for this."
369715,31717,2011-01-19,5,I loved this. I followed the recipe other then I didn't add the celery as I didn't have any. I also used black beans and northern beans as that is all I had on hand. I added the optional tabasco sauce. I topped mine with parm cheese. This was so good. Great flavor.
226863,31717,2011-08-09,5,"I came home from work for lunch and threw this in the crockpot, and came home to a delicious soup.  It's been quite a while since I ate at Olive Garden, but I do remember this soup, and it is very close.  This is a very hearty, filling soup.  I will enjoy making this in the winter when it is cold!  I added the pasta in the bowl, as many of the other reviewers did.  Thanks for sharing!"
39835,31717,2011-11-05,5,"Wonderful and easy! I did need to cut the recipe down a bit to fit in my crockpot by using only 1 pound ground beef, 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks, and half the amount of tomatoes -- otherwise kept the remainder of ingredients and it came out wonderful! Thanks for sharing!"
482376,31717,2014-01-18,5,"This was great soup and so easy to throw together. It had great flavor! I used 1 1/4 lbs of ground turkey and it still worked out beautifully. Other than that, I kept the recipe the same. Yummy!"
37449,56694,2005-09-30,5,I made this for my DH last night and he enjoyed it. His friend came over and had one too! I halved the recipe.Thank you!
136997,56694,2006-02-22,5,"Delicious! I served roasted spuds with this, so I didn't need to double the sauce. There was just enough. Nice flavor. :)"
173579,56694,2011-05-15,5,This was a very tasty recipe. We loved the French Onion Soup in it.  Thanks for posting.
158086,56694,2011-08-13,5,"Excellent!  I doubled the sauce but used one can of golden mushroom  as I only had one french onion can,turned out great...I did add some fresh mushrooms..."
140132,56694,2011-08-22,5,Very good meal.  I served this with mashed potatoes (of course :) ) and crispy eggplant....yum.  I did use ground turkey in place of the ground beef and it turned out perfect.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe with us.
140132,48635,2009-09-10,4,This is a good pancake mix.  I will make this alot as its cheaper and just as easy as the box stuff.  Thank you for sharing this with me.
1179225,48635,2013-01-26,5,"This is a fantastic basic pancake recipe. I usually look for healthier pancake recipes with a little more umph to get through the day. But, today I was in the mood for a nice, light, traditional pancake. This fit the bill perfectly. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
383346,185342,2008-01-14,5,I used 1 pound of chicken tenders.  Maybe it was too much for the quantity of breadcrumbs mixture.  But the taste was yummy!  And the chicken was tender.  Thanks Lainey :) Made for Zaar Star Game
5060,185342,2008-01-24,4,"Very moist and tender, we enjoyed it very much, but I did find it hard to get the coat to stick.  I ended up spraying the chicken with veggie spray and then coating it.
Lovely flavours! Thanks for posting!"
280271,185342,2008-03-14,5,I have to give this a 5 star rating. I found that it was full of flavor. It was nice and moist plus it was tender. I did toss it around in the bag with all the coating mixture. Saved a plate...:) This will be made again. Easy dish to prepare on a work night. Thanks Laniey6605 for posting.
88099,185342,2008-11-07,5,"This was excellent.  I used this to put on top of recipe #294654 for a complete one plate meal.  The two went so well together.  For rating purposes, I tried this recipe separate from the other and we loved it.  I cut my chicken into strips and then doubled the breading because there were more pieces to cover.  Because we like a little spice, I used 1/2 paprika and 1/2 cayenne pepper to give it a little zip.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks Lainey"
369715,185342,2008-11-18,5,Very good and easy to make. Followd the recipe exactly as written and everyone enjoyed them.
204024,185342,2011-10-21,5,This is a great recipe that I am really excited about.  I am starting weight watchers next week and this is a wonderful WW recipe.  Made for PRMR.
169430,185342,2011-04-29,5,Perfectly delicious and perfectly simple. Since it's baked I tucked the thin tapering end of the breast under the thicker part so that it all cooked evenly and made as directed. How can you not love something this good that is also healthy!
171790,185342,2011-05-07,5,"This is a very flavorful, delicious chicken dish. I grated my own parmesan and used homemade breadcrumbs to which I added homemade Italian seasoning. The recipe was followed as written and turned out perfectly. Thanks for sharing."
107583,185342,2011-05-27,5,"Not much I can add to 115 other reviews, but this is very good!  I will cut the breast into cutlets next time, though, as they were a bit thick.  I served plain as written, but will try them with some tomato sauce next time.  Very quick and easy, btw."
542159,185342,2011-08-10,5,"Let see this chicken was yummy, easy and healthy that makes it a winner hands down. Made using chicken tenders instead of cutlets because that is what I had on hand and adjust the cooking time to accommodate the tenders, but no other changes were made. This is a keeper that will be enjoyed again. Thanks for the post."
452940,185342,2011-08-26,4,"We enjoyed these for lunch today. I did brush a little mayo on them before breading so it would adhere better, and it also helps the chicken stay tender.  Thanks for sharing the recipe."
1179225,185342,2012-01-20,5,"Why would you make chicken parmesan any other way? This chicken was so juicy, tender and perfectly seasoned. I pounded the chicken, and smeared it lighlty with low fat mayo just to keep the breading on. It came out perfect. I'll be making this again. Thanks for posting."
140132,185342,2012-01-28,5,I made this last night for dinner and we loved it.  The parmesan is so flavorful when baked....yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 22 minutes.  The dish came out perfect.  thank you for sharing this great recipe with us.
461834,185342,2012-02-17,5,"Well I didn't realize how popular this recipe is, until I tagged it in PRMR Tag Game and went to review it!!!!  I made this for my lunch, so scaled it back for one.  I wasn't serving this with pasta, so I did add some marinara sauce and then topped it with some mozzarella, which I know would up the points/calories, but it was so good.  I too, used fresh shredded parmesan in place of the grated Kraft kind.  I had this with some carrot sticks, as I knew I was also going to meet my DS at the movie theater and knew I would be eating buttered popcorn and this would help keep my calories to where they should be.  Thanks for sharing a great lo-cal recipe Lainey!!!"
131126,39087,2004-03-23,5,"I made this for dinner tonight, What can I say except WOW! we really enjoyed this recipe."
169969,39087,2005-01-07,5,This was sooooo GOOD! The sauce was so yummy I couldn't stop tasting it. I used ChrisMc's Cajun Seasoning (33092) when I realized I did not have prepared cajun seasoning. It made the perfect amount. This was so quick and easy! I added peas as suggested...but the dish really does not need any extra ingredients - it can stand on its own. I used 2 cups of heavy cream and 8 ounces of pasta. I was going to post a photo but Dannygirl's photo was much prettier. Thank you so much!
176615,39087,2005-01-07,5,"Fabulous! I used 1 cup whipping cream, sun-dried tomatoes in oil, otherwise as stated in the recipe. Very tasty, easy and quick. Spicy, but not overly so, though this would depend on your cajun seasoning. Would be really good with crawfish or shrimp as well. Thanks, Lorac, for a wonderful dinner!"
158086,39087,2005-04-07,5,Add me to the list of lovers of this recipe...i used half and half instead of whip cream and it was still rich and wonderful...
140132,39087,2007-02-01,5,"This is very good.  My whole family devoured this.  It has great flavor and easy to make too, which is a plus for me...lol.  I love the tomatoes in this with the added cream....how can you go wrong???  lol   Thank you for a nice pasta meal, I served this with a green salad and some garlic bread.......Stephanie"
8688,39087,2007-02-14,5,"Excellent!! The chicken was flavorful and tender and the sauce was the perfect complement!  I used a full two cups of half and half because I found I was out of whipping cream.  The half and half worked perfectly well. I will most definitely serve this again : )  Thanks, Lorac!"
452355,39087,2008-02-05,5,"DH and I were looking for something that would be really quick to prepare last night, but tasty too.  This definitely fit the bill. Spicy, creamy flavor, less than 10 minute prep---we will definitely be making this again.  We thought the addition of the sun-dried tomatoes made the dish really nice.  I made no alterations to the recipe.  Thanks for posting."
173579,39087,2008-04-24,5,Very good meal.  Quick and easy .  Thanks for posting.
1072593,39087,2008-12-15,5,Should you need one signature dish in life...this would be it!
126440,39087,2009-01-05,5,"I made this with one chicken breast and 1/2 lb. shrimp.  Cooked the chicken first then added the shrimp.  When shrimp was turned the first time, I added the remaining ingredients but only 1 t. sun dried tomatoes and 3/4 c. half and half.  I sprinkled 1 t. cajun seasoning on each the chicken and shrimp while cooking.  It was excellent!  I will make this often for special dinners."
226863,39087,2009-10-25,5,"Loved the taste of this recipe!  So easy and so delicious.  I did find the sauce a little thin, so I thickened it with a little cornstarch so that it would stick to the linguine.  Fabulous dish!  Thanks Lorac.  I'm so glad I chose this recipe tonight!"
323186,39087,2009-11-17,5,"Fabulous!!!   We all loved this, voted one of the best meals I've made recently and So Simple!!!   My daughters absolutely cleaned it up and they are not always the most enthusiastic eaters.

Made as per recipe,  and I had three slices of cooked bacon in the fridge, so chopped them finely and added them as well.  Used my own oven-dried tomatoes.  My cream container had about a cup and a half in it, I poured in a little boiling water and shook it up to get the whole lot, for me the sauce was just perfect. 

This was just Fabulous, Lorac!!!!!! A total keeper! Thank you so much!"
39835,20155,2003-05-12,5,Excellent potato salad and so easy! I made a few changes because I was out of some of the ingredients--instead of bacon I used artificial bacon bits and I eliminated the celery. I also ran out of mayonnaise and used about 1 cup of mayonnaise and 1/2 cup of low-fat sour cream. The only other change I made was slicing the hard-boiled eggs instead of chopping them.  Even with my subsitutions this salad was excellent and will definitely be making it again this summer.
53932,20155,2005-09-05,4,"I'm very picky about potato salads and this is a good one.  I used  creole mustard, a little more salt than indicated and also added pepper.  I didn't add sugar and added less relish than called for (just personal preferences).  The bacon adds a nice flavor to the salad."
169969,20155,2007-04-05,5,I made a double batch of this to accompany lunch for a group of construction workers and they absolutely loved it! One guy even asked for the recipe!!! I weighed the potatoes and the mayo amount was perfect for the pounds listed. I used Vidalia Onions instead of Red Onions and also omitted the egg. I chopped up regular pickles as we were out of relish. I would make this again and again. Fabulous Potato Salad! Thanks Karen!
140132,20155,2008-01-17,5,"Oh my. I made this just as written and it is so delicious.  We love potato salad anyway but the added flavors in this is outstanding.  I will not go back to my old recipe.  This is my recipe from now on.  Wow, so good.  The only thing I will do differently next time is chop the celery a little smaller.  DD likes celery but chopped finely, no problem.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe.  I can't wait to try this out on family and friends they are gonna love it too.  Thank you for this ""show off"" recipe......Stephanie"
173579,20155,2010-08-26,5,This is a wonderful potato salad.  Loved the bacon in it.  It was so creamy and delicious.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
158086,20155,2012-03-15,5,Very good potato salad.  Never put bacon in potato salad before but it works!
128473,2496,2007-01-15,5,"This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tried.  It's official,  it tastes as great as it smells while baking. The cake is rich, thick, light and moist, tender and it explodes with chocolate flavour and has a wonderful texture. Thanks so much for sharing Marg, I love your recipes, they never disappoint."
8688,2496,2007-02-15,5,"Now, this is a real chocolate cake!  There is no question when diving into a slice of this dense, moist and deeply flavorful cake that you are eating ~ chocolate!  Easy to follow instructions for the perfect 2 layer chocolate heaven!   I used recipe #89207 using the most cocoa powder (3/4 cup) for the darkest and deepest chocolate frosting.  Thank you, Marg, for a wonderful, chocolate experience : )"
140132,2496,2007-08-15,5,What a moist cake.  I've never been a big fan of chocolate cake as I've always thought they were dry and crumbly.  Not so. This is a delicious recipe....thank you for opening my eyes to chocolate cake....mmmmmmm.  This is a winner in my books since its so simple and basic ingredients.....thank you.....Stephanie
176615,2496,2007-09-12,5,Delicious! Made this for DH's birthday along with recipe#89207 as Marg suggested. I live in a very humid area so took Marg's advice and used 2/3 cup water. Mine did fall slightly as it cooled but was still quite moist without being heavy or thick. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
80353,2496,2008-10-10,5,My kids were thanking me for making this cake for them yesterday - how could I possibly give it anything less than 5 star?  Very tender and moist.
104295,2496,2009-05-14,5,"Perfect for what I needed, a not too hard to make chocolate cake that I could make in layers and frost.  Thanks."
1179225,2496,2011-09-11,5,Excellent!
126440,2496,2011-10-17,5,Very easy but delicious cake.  I made half a recipe using a 9X9 inch pan.  Turned out great but may have over baked it a bit.  Baked for 35 min.  I did use the choc. buttercream for the frosting which was also great.  Made for a very rich birthday cake.  Want to try it with coffee next time.
173579,145064,2007-10-21,5,Very good.  Quick and easy.  Will be using this a lot.  Thanks for posting.
47892,145064,2007-11-24,5,"Easy recipe, good flavor. Note: gravy thickens up as it sits. I had 1 cup of drippings then added 3 cups of fresh turkey stock. Served this on Thanksgiving. Thanks Kittencal!"
204024,145064,2008-11-27,5,"We served this at Thanksgiving dinner alongside a turkey also prepared to Kittencal's instructions.  My only concern is that the recipe would have you discard the turkey fat and replace it with butter; we used some of each to make up the whole amount and it worked well.  I skimmed the fat, added butter, browned the flour in both, and slowly added the broth back in. Delicious and well-received. Thank you, Kittencal, for another winner!"
140132,145064,2009-11-09,5,"Perfect gravy!  I used some chicken broth that I had frozen from another time added that to the drippings and it turned out perfect.  This is so simple I don't know why I didn't think of this before!  I plan on using this all the time,  Thank you so much for sharing this with me, now I have perfect gravy!!!!!!"
1072593,145064,2009-12-25,5,I'm thinking I'm going to have to follow you around just to take notes.  You are one bad self.
1179225,145064,2015-09-24,5,"So, so good! I&#039;m really glad we tried this perfect gravy. We did cut back on the butter by about half and it was perfect for us. Thanks so much for posting! Update: made a veggie version using veggie broth added a tiny bit of poultry seasoning and some white pepper. Loved it! Thanks!"
6357,69630,2004-03-12,5,"This cake rose beautifully in my cake pan when I made it this evening. I love chocolate too and I frosted it with chocolate frosting myself. I did substitute low-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream. We enjoyed this cake and I will be making it for sure, again! Thank you for the recipe!"
173579,69630,2007-04-04,5,This was a fantastic recipe.  I made this for my son's birthday.  He really did enjoy it.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
140132,69630,2008-01-08,5,"I made this for DD's birthday.  We loved the almond flavoring in this.  It is such a beautiful cake and moist....yummy.  I will definately make this again as it turned out perfect.......thanks, Stephanie"
400708,69630,2008-03-02,4,"Thanks Donna for a gread recipe.  I cut it in half (didn't have THAT many people coming) for a birthday cake for my DGS.  Was making a snow boarding mountain and wanted to make sure it wouldn't collapse under the weight.  It turned out perfect, the directions were easy to follow and the taste was lovely.  Thanks for posting."
324390,69630,2008-08-04,5,"Incredible cake! This got rave reviews from everyone who attended a baby shower I helped to throw for my sister-in-law. I made the cake a week ahead and froze it wrapped in a layer of plastic wrap and then foil and sent it to my mom's house for her to decorate. My mom decorated it so cute and had no problems with the layering. I was worried that the outside was not going to be as good as the inside, but I shouldn't have. It had a great texture and not dry at all. I reduced the vanilla by 1 tsp. and added an extra tsp. of almond extract. My grandmother who loves almond flavoring loved it but my aunt who hates almond flavoring loved it too, she even had 2 pieces! We also used about 1/2 to 3/4 of a jar of seedless raspberry jam between the layers which worked perfectly. We had no left-over cake for ourselves because many people requested pieces to take home! Thank you so much for the recipe Donna!"
126440,69630,2009-05-21,5,I took this to a potluck and it got rave reviews.  Very easy to do and the flavor is great. I did make half a recipe and used a 15 X 10 inch jelly roll pan and baked for 23 min.  I used Recipe #282040 for the frosting.
176615,69630,2009-07-10,5,"Made a half-recipe using 2 9-inch round pans for my son's birthday cake. As easy as a boxed cake mix but with better flavor, moist, dense, and stands up well to decorating. Can't wait to try the chocolate and lemon versions as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe! UPDATE: Have also made the chocolate version, this time used three 9-inch round pans for a triple layer cake. Worked really well, a nice moist cake that frosts easily."
1179225,69630,2016-06-30,5,"Soooo delicious! Light but rich. I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for just shy of an hour. I think I could have taken it out about 5 mins sooner, the edges got a little tough. I cut the cake in half and froze half. I split the other half and iced the center with PB icing and iced the entire cake with buttercream icing. Delicious! I'm looking forward to trying all sorts of variations of this keeper recipe. Thanks for sharing."
171790,128956,2007-05-09,5,This soup is so good. It doesn't taste like a diet food.
67656,128956,2007-08-11,0,"Posting only comments as I think some of my changes may have affected my results.  I was given a green cabbage other than the type intended and decided to give it a try. (Though I could not say what kind, it was not savoy, Napa, or bok choy.) The flavors of the soup were just delicious and overall I enjoyed it very much. (My one suggestion would be to increase the liquid to 5 cups.)  That said, my poor cabbage did not hold up very well even though I added it towards the end with the zucchini.  While the firmer white parts were fine, the leafy greens were a little water logged. Posting this as a caution to other venturesome chefs."
452940,128956,2008-09-08,5,"This is really flavorful. I omitted the green beans and zucchini but added chopped celery and a dash of cayenne. My mom went on WW years ago, and ate this alot because you can eat it whenever your feeling hungry without worries or guilt. Thanks for posting. :)"
17803,128956,2009-09-11,4,"Yum, I doubled the carrots, gr beans and zucchini.  With all the green going on in this soup I decided to use red cabbage. Thank you for posting.   Made for *Zaar Cookbook Tag 2009* game"
226863,128956,2010-10-09,5,"This is very good!  I've made cabbage soup for diets with chicken stock, but the beef stock added a whole new dimension.  Loved the suggestions posted by others....adding beans, etc, but I made this recipe to fill me up and not add calories or carbs.  I chose not to use the zucchini, and subbed spinach.  Perfection!  I'll try adding some mushrooms next time, because I think they would be great in this."
542159,128956,2010-10-16,5,Have had many version of this soup and must say this is the best one yet. Made a double batch and just eyeballing  the vegetables instead of measuring them. Did make one substation as I was out of tomato paste used ketchup instead. Also added some bouillon. Will make this one again. Thanks so much for the post.
653438,128956,2011-11-06,5,"Delicious!  Fixed this as written only adding some left over corn, a stalk of celery and kidney beans...it was so good on a rainy cool day.  Served it with a side salad and bread.  Made for November TOTM Diabetes forum."
140132,128956,2012-02-11,4,"I made this soup, only adding some ground turkey to it. ( I know it doesn't make it 0 pts.) but my family eats it better with some meat.  It was really good.  I will continue to make, thankyou for sharing."
482376,128956,2013-01-17,4,"Great soup! I enjoyed the variety of veggies, the ease of preparation and the flavor. Most of all, I loved the health factor. I did find that I needed to add about 1 more cup of liquid. Thanks so much for posting!"
593927,128956,2013-08-05,3,"Sorry but this just was not great. I added more vegetables and a bit more spice but it was bland. We don&#039;t like spicy btw. I used an organic beef vegetable broth, organic garlic, organic tomato paste, organic green cabbage, organic yellow onion, grated organic carrots, organic yellow beans instead if green, no zucchini as I had none on hand but added half an organic green pepper, fresh organic green peas in the pod, dried basil, organic fresh marjoram in place of oregano in a greater amount, a dash of cayenne pepper powder, sea salt &amp; freshly ground black pepper. This may be a bit better the second day but I don&#039;t think we will finish it! DD1 (6 years old) loves soup but said this was only ok. I made a similar recipe before which had more flavour if I want this type of soup I will look for my review."
400708,128956,2015-08-19,4,"Loved this dageret, I followed the direction exactly (except for Zucchini as I had none) and it was great for lunch, then I decided to try it for a base for dinner and added a potatoe with some left over port - still healthy and low in fat and it was great.  Served it with my sage rolls and it made for a hearty, warm and satisfying dinner.  I can imagine a lot of things could be added, but I like it just as written for when those HUNGRIES strike.  Update: August, 2015.  Continue to use this just as written, though I do double it then freeze in batches to handle those times when hunger strikes or just a a lovely fall dinner with a slice of home made bread and a class of red wine - Yum and not bad on the calorie side"
53932,80413,2005-08-27,4,"Though the rolls tasted good, I had difficulty working with the dough.  It was extremely sticky.  I baked them for about 18 minutes at 350."
88099,80413,2005-10-28,5,"Wow.  These are excellent buns.  Love the texture and very easy to make.  I made mine a little too large, but so what.  They were great.  Had Marg@Cayman Designs' Bull's Eye Burger recipe #122535 with this and it made for a great meal.  Thanks.  I'll work on my sizing next time."
160974,80413,2008-10-31,5,"I've made these twice with GREAT results. The first time my kitchen was humid and my dough was super sticky. I kept adding flour to make it manageable. My rolls DID turn out delightful, though. The second time my kitchen was much cooler and my flour amount was fine. Both times I did not roll the dough, but shaped into balls, flattening the tops a bit.  These rolls were so light but with a nice sturdy texture (like the ones in the photos). Thanks Marie!
Roxygirl"
126440,80413,2009-11-08,5,Great buns.  I made this using 3/4 c. whole wheat but as written otherwise.  I only got 10 buns using 3 1/2 inch rounds.  Great flavor and easy to do. I did have to cook mine longer (14 min.)
140132,80413,2013-08-27,5,I made these to go with some turkey burgers I made and they were perfect.  They were moist and lite which complimented the burgers beautifully.  thank you for sharing with us.  We loved them.
400708,80413,2018-12-12,5,"OMG, these turned out sooooo good and so much better than store bought, I'll never buy them again. Using the bread machine made it easy and the results - Wow!! I did brush mine before baking with an egg white and top with toasted sesame seeds, the inside of these came out pillowy soft, but still firm enough to stand up to all our hamburger fixings. As I said, NEVER buy store bought again"
160974,95222,2005-01-13,5,"We really enjoyed this easy pork chop recipe. I used fresh ginger  and did not change anything. I would encourage people not to skip the browning step. You really need a good searing to develop flavor in this dish. I sliced thinly and coated with the sauce. Very kid-friendly, too.
Roxygirl in Colo."
176615,95222,2005-01-26,5,"Yum-yum! I used very thick pork chops, at least an inch, and cooked the full hour, basting a few times with the sauce. They were well done, almost too done, so I'd suggest watching that these puppies don't dry out on you in the oven. The sauce was quite nice, gave the pork which I often find to be bland and dry, a good bit of flavor. The kids also liked this very much. Thanks, Brad!"
173579,95222,2005-03-02,4,"These were very tasty.  Bake time was too long, but will make again.  Thanks for posting."
8688,95222,2005-03-13,5,"My husband says, ""Be sure to save this recipe!"" So, I won't allow this one to go far ; )  I tripled the sauce because I am married to Mr Condiments.  He likes everything with sauce to have more than enough.  This sauce is delicious!  I used six 3/4"" pork loin chops and the hour given was just right. Thanks for sharing this with us, Brad!"
140132,95222,2006-09-18,5,"well... like all the other reviewers we loved this recipe.  My picky 16 yr old son walked in the door and said, ""man supper smells amazing"".   Needless to say this is now one of our regular chop recipes.  thank you for a great dinner idea.
"
136997,95222,2007-01-22,4,"This was delicious. I used 1"" chops and believe next time I will cut the cooking time back to 40 min. My husband really enjoyed the sauce. :)"
133174,95222,2007-02-18,5,"What can I add that hasn't already been said?  I browned this in a cast iron pan, poured the sauce over and placed in the oven.  The chops I used were easily 3/4 inch thick and required the full cooking time.  Served this along with recipe #195903 for a wonderful meal."
89831,95222,2007-06-09,3,"This is good and very similar to my recipe#134655 but I think I prefer my recipe to this one, it just did not have enough ""oomph"" to it, but thank you for sharing anyway...Kitten"
158086,95222,2007-08-16,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe...I too cooked it on top of the stove as other reviews, and uncovered it after 15 minutes to let sauce thicken up...served with rice....easy eye appealing recipe."
126440,95222,2010-11-16,5,I doubled the sauce but most of it cooked away.  I would cook them less time as mine were a little dry.  Flavor is out of this world good.  Served with Recipe #256364.
482376,95222,2012-10-01,4,"The flavor is wonderful! I doubled the sauce and am glad I did. This would be great served over rice, I think. I used the oven method, but found that the pork chops were too dry after only about 35 minutes of cooking. I wish I would have checked them even earlier. This recipe is worth making again and experimenting on the timing. Thank you for posting. Made for Cookbook Tag game in the Cooking Tag Games forums."
560491,95222,2013-01-24,5,Very good chops!  Only change I made was I used pork steaks rather than chops.  Perfect amount of sweet and salty.  Made for I Recommend Tag.
400708,95222,2013-09-28,5,"I love this recipe, though I did make a few minor changes.  I used 2 thick chops, fresh ginger, and fresh garlic instead of salt.  Arghhh, just now realized I forgot the honey which I&#039;m sure would have made it even better; followed another reviewer and made it all on the stove top simmering in a covered pan.  Doubled the sauce and at the end added some flour to make a gravy and served with steamed rice and a salad.  So good - loved the flavors and really mad at myself for forgetting the honey which would have made it even better.  So easy to put together and full of flavor."
128473,95222,2016-04-21,4,"Thank you for sharing your recipe.  We enjoyed the pork chops prepared this way.  Quick and easy to make entree, the pork chops were perfectly cooked and the sauce was thin but very tasty.  What a lovely meal, served with aspargus and jasmine rice. Made for What&#039;s on the Menu Tag Game."
29196,28148,2002-05-16,4,"This was quick and tasty, but I found the tortillas a bit dry-maybe the brand I used was the problem. I would LOVE the filling in tacos with lettuce, cheese and sour dream on top. Yum."
126440,28148,2004-06-20,5,Very good recipe.  We had this a couple days ago and had some left over.  It is very filling.  I mixed green chili sauce and cream of mushroom soup (had it left over from Taco Ritos)  this goes together very quickly and has great flavor.
89831,28148,2004-07-16,5,"Miss Annie these were just to die for! I made mine with salsa, and added just a little fresh chopped garlic in with the chicken mixture, and brushed them with melted butter instead of margarine, I don't use margarine in my house. they were just so yummy. I baked them in the morning, as it is very hot in the afternoon, so I have already gobbled down one, and am trying very hard not to eat another one LOL! I doubled the recipe for these, as DS and fiance will be over tonight, these will be gone in a flash...excellent recipe Miss Annie!, I will make these again and again! thanks so much for posting...Kittencal:)"
133174,28148,2004-12-11,5,"These are excellent!  I haven't made chimichangas in a long time because to be good they need to be nice and crisp.  I did not use the butter.  Instead I used my olive mister and lightly sprayed the filled tortillas.  Also, used turkey for the chicken.  They came out crisp and delicious.  "
136997,28148,2005-08-31,5,Thumbs up from my husband.:)I used a store bought roasted chicken. I also used extra chunky/mild salsa as I can't handle spicy foods very well. The recipe made 8 pieces for me.
53932,28148,2006-01-25,5,"Very, very good.  I made the recipe just as written but think I will follow the suggestions for adding additional spices next time.  It's easy to scale this down for one serving for a quick lunch.  Thanks for the recipe."
158086,28148,2006-03-28,5,These turned out perfect...I made the chicken meat in the crockpot so it would shred easily...turned out perfect...
176615,28148,2006-03-31,5,"Delicious! Quick to make and a great use for leftover chicken or even turkey. We added a little sour cream on top at serving. Yum! Thanks, Miss Annie, for a great recipe! UPDATE I've made these often since my first review. We had them tonight using whole wheat tortillas which was wonderful! I spritzed with canola oil and baked as directed. Would suggest lining the pan with foil for easy clean up. A simple dinner that goes together in no time. Thanks, Miss Annie!"
8688,28148,2006-10-06,5,"We love Mexican Food!  So why did it take me so long to make this wonderful recipe that has gotten over 128 incredible reviews?  I sure don't know, but I did know for sure that when it come to great food, Miss Annie's recipes are the place to come.  Especially for Mexican Food, see the Queen of San Antonio!  Our Dinner tonight was exceptional and I have to say, I wasn't at all surprised by the results.  Miss Annie never lets me down!  I served this wonderful dish with Maine-iac's <a href=""/18048"">Creamy Green Chile Sauce</a> which proved to be the perfect complement.  Thanks ever so, dear, Miss Annie!!"
173579,28148,2006-12-12,3,We liked these ok.  Didn't like them as much as some of the other mexican dishes.  Thanks for posting.
280271,28148,2007-02-16,5,"This is a quick, easy and tasty recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand. Even the left over chicken from the night before. I added a touch of cilantro on top of the sour cream. Served them with seasoned tater tots. Oh! don't forget the margarita. Update: Here it is about 1 year later (2/16/07) and this time I make them with Multi-grain tortillas. They came out execellent like normal. I also used lowfat cheddar cheese. Thanks, Miss Annie for a great recipe that can be repeated over and over again."
498271,28148,2007-08-31,5,Delicious and so easy to make!  I sprayed cooking spray on both sides of the chimichangas before putting them in the oven (instead of brushing with melted butter) and they were perfect!
174096,28148,2008-01-13,4,"Thank you for a tasty recipe!  I used homemade salsa and served it with a light cheese and salsa sauce over top, garnished with diced tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and lettuce."
140132,28148,2008-01-19,5,"Like this recipe needs another 5 star review, but I must give credit where credit is due.  These for fantastic. I love chimis and the fact that these are baked is even better. I served these along with refried beans and spanish rice and also some tortilla chips.  On the side I setour  shredded chedder cheese, sour cream, avacado slices, black olives, green onions , jalapeno slices and salsa.  HUGE HIT  Thank you for posting.....Stephanie"
166642,28148,2008-08-24,5,"These are excellent. I've made these several time already and they turn out great. I usually double the recipe so that I can freeze some of them for a snack later on. You definitely have to watch them baking to make sure they don't get burned. Mine are usually golden brown and crispy in about 25 minutes. During the last 5 minutes, I sprinkle some more shredded cheese on top."
88099,28148,2008-10-17,4,"This was very easy to put together and the flavors combination was really good.  The only change I made was to use chili powder instead of the cumin.  Next time, I'll add maybe some chopped jalapeno peppers to zip it up a little.  My salsa was a little on the bland side for us.  All in all a very nice recipes.  Made for ""Think Pink"""
5060,28148,2009-02-01,5,"wow what can I say, I am 508th to say there are very good and i would make them again, thanks for posting! We loved them!"
560491,28148,2009-06-24,4,"These were good and crispy and not greasy like you would gt from frying them!!!  I made a while ago (behind on reviews) but both DH and I loved them.  I didn't cut down the recipe so we would have leftovers.  Will make again, next will try with shredded beef!"
222564,28148,2009-08-25,5,One word; SUPERB!!!
1179225,28148,2009-08-31,5,"We thought these were great! I did add cilantro and topped them with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream. Very easy and very yummy!"
104295,28148,2009-10-04,5,"I'm review #579 so we already know these are good, but it was a wonderful use of my leftover shredded chicken that had been in the freezer.  I used some enchilada sauce and didn't measure the cheese.  My pickiest eater didn't love it, but ate some.  The rest of us liked it a lot.  Thanks!"
6357,15411,2006-03-02,5,These are awesome cookies that go very well at my home. I usually add 1/2-1 tsp. of vanilla essence to these flourless PB cookies. This is a wonderful cookie recipe:)  
424680,15411,2008-02-17,5,"Loved these cookies! They couldn't be easier to make! I used chunky peanut butter [& probably would have included even more chopped peanuts if I'd had some]! Well worth making again! [Tagged, made & reviewed for the Cookbook Tag game]"
140132,15411,2009-03-04,4,So easy!  Thanks for posting.
1179225,15411,2009-09-20,5,"I made these for for a family gathering, everyone loved them and could not believe they were made with three ingredients. Mine weren't crumbly at all, just soft and delicious. This will be my PB cookie recipe from now on. Thank you for posting!"
37449,15411,2009-11-17,5,"So doggone easy! And my DH, the peanut butter lover in the house, adores them. Thanks!"
383346,15411,2013-03-13,5,These cookies are so easy to do.  And the taste is so good.  It's hard to eat just one.  Thanks Mysterygirl :)  Made for Holiday tag game
173579,15411,2014-03-23,5,Fantastic!  Thanks for posting.
88099,78814,2004-09-24,3,"Although these tasted great, there is way too much chicken filling for the stated 8 oz Crescent Rolls.  You only need about half of what this recipe calls for."
126440,78814,2004-11-15,5,"Made this yesterday for dinner.  It is excellent.  I used poached chicken breasts, low fat cheese, low fat cream cheese, and fat-free half and half. The taste is awesome. You must try this one.  "
131126,78814,2004-11-29,4,"After reading the reviews, I cut the filling mixture in half and it worked perfectly for 1 can of rolls.  I also sprinkled the finished casserole with garlic powder & paprika.  DH really liked this casserole, but I didn't care much for the texture. My star rating is a compromise between his 5 and my 3 stars. So mixed results at my house :)  Thank you for sharing your recipe."
169969,78814,2004-12-02,5,"I planned on making this last night for me and by BF when my friend’s daughter called and said she was coming over. Since she is vegetarian I made two different dishes; one with the chicken mixture (with chopped fresh spinach) and the other with spinach, onion and broccoli (using Cream of Mushroom Soup). After reading all the reviews I only put a small amount of the cream mixture in the bottom of the baking dish and I used the jumbo crescent rolls. The chicken mixture was easy to pour but the Cream of Mushroom was too thick to pour….so I added some Fat Free Half and Half to the baking dish. They were not soggy at all and both cooked perfectly. Also, all the mixture fit into the jumbo rolls! OMG were these the bomb!!! My friend’s daughter said she is going to eat them everyday and that it was the best thing she had ever eaten. She begged me to show her how to make them and took the leftovers home. This was definitely a hit at my house!********"
8688,78814,2005-04-12,4,"This is a very good recipe and worth holding on to!  I used shredded mozzarella, but think next time I will use the cheddar as it will provide more flavor.  I also think that the next time I make this recipe that I will put all the sauce over the crescent rolls because even though I baked for a longer period of time, some of the rolls still came out doughy on the bottom. The flavor was wonderful!  I can see this chicken filling used with phyllo-pastry cups, using the same sauce.  This would prevent the doughiness I experienced. I will definitely make this recipe again!  Thanks, Kittencal!"
158086,78814,2005-06-23,5,Wish I could give this more than 5 stars...smelled wonderful and was a great recipe for all the left over chicken I had...thanks
173579,78814,2005-12-12,5,This was a very good casserole.  I did use the chive and onion cream cheese. It was wonderful.  I put all the cream of chicken mixture on the top.  Was not soggy this way.  My family is already wanting this again.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
140132,78814,2006-12-15,5,"Excellent recipe!  I had some leftover chicken from previous meal and found this recipe.  Oh so good. I doubled the recipe, but only used one can of soup and it turned out perfect for us, that you so much for this wonderful way to use up leftover chicken.   Stephanie"
136997,78814,2006-12-29,5,"Well, what more can be said about this recipe? Just a couple of things maybe LoL! I didn't add sauce on the bottom and baked it 10 min. more then suggested. My husband mmmmm'd his way thru the entire dinner. I believe if there hadn't been the 3 of us, he would have eaten half himself.:)"
226863,78814,2006-12-29,3,"I thought this was good for a ""kid"" feast, but not really good for an adult meal. I can see it being served successfully at a spend-the-night party for kids, especially if you leave the onions out and use the shredded cheese. I'm not a big fan of crescent rolls though, so that may have influenced my opinion.  On the other hand, I love chicken/turkey and cream cheese, so I had high hopes for the recipe.  For adults, I thought there was way too much sauce, and the rolls were soggy, even though I baked them by themselves for 15 minutes.  I would follow other reviewer's advice and have them serve the sauce ""on the side"", and not cook the rolls with it.  The sauce was a bit overpowering and made the rolls soggy.  I'll try this one again with some alterations.  It has promise, just needs a little tweaking."
1179225,78814,2010-03-06,5,Mmmmm.....this is such a great idea. I'm looking forward to making it again and mixing it up a little. I brought the leftovers to work to reheat for lunch and they were just as good. Thanks so much for posting!
369715,78814,2011-04-02,3,I liked this but the rest of the family didn't. I made the sauce but only put some on the top and didn't put any on the bottom of the pan. I did use the garlic but only 1/2 teaspoon and the rest of my family said that was all they could taste. I did omit the seasoning salt and only used 1/2 cup of cheese in the filling. It was something different. I also had to cook mine for 50 minutes to get the dough cooked.
160974,33489,2005-04-11,5,"I really love coleslaw and enjoy making lots of different kinds. I'd never made one with buttermilk before, but knew I'd love the cream tang of it in the dressing. Thanks for posting!

88099,33489,2005-04-16,5,"This is the only way I make cole slaw.  I will sometimes add a 1/2 tsp of celery seed, extra lemon juice and quartered cherry tomatoes, just to change it up some.  Absolutely wonderful."
158086,33489,2005-06-23,5,This was quick and tasty...the only thing I changed was I used Tarragon Vinegar and Splendra...this will be my only cole slaw recipe from now on...
37449,33489,2005-10-07,5,"Delicious! I love this kind of ""wet"" cole slaw. Sweet and tangy, just the way I like it! Thank you!"
176615,33489,2006-08-27,5,Very good creamy coleslaw that's not too heavy. Easy to make and a lovely side to spicy ribs. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
140132,33489,2007-01-30,4,This is a good coleslaw. I made it exactly as written and my family enjoyed it. I will be saving this for this summer when we seem to eat alot more salads. Thank you for this simple and tasty recipe....Stephanie
8688,33489,2007-04-24,5,"Oh, Sharlene!  This is so good!  I was only able to allow  this to sit in the refrigerator for a couple hours before serving, but none the less, it was superb!  This is such an easy recipe and I followed it to a ""T"".  Thank you so much for sharing, Sharlene!"
157425,33489,2008-05-15,5,So close to KFC's cole slaw! I used the packaged cole slaw mix that can be bought in the produce section. It has carrots in the mix so I didnt add more. There was liquid in the bottom of the bowl but our KFC cole slaw has the same. Before serving I tossed it together again and didnt seem to have a problem. My family enjoyed this for dinner on Mother's Day.
53932,33489,2008-06-15,4,"Good coleslaw!  As I knew that this much sugar would be a bit too much for me, I reduced the amount by a few teaspoons."
126440,33489,2009-08-11,5,Great coleslaw.  I cut the recipe to serve 4 and chilled for 2 hours.  It was spot on.  DH really liked this one.
1179225,33489,2009-10-04,4,"Nice flavor. Will make again with a little more mayo. We like a creamier slaw, I also added a couple drops of Franks and a shake of celery seed. Thanks for posting!"
653438,33489,2011-05-31,5,Wonderful!  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag and what a wonderful coleslaw.  I cut the recipe in half for DH and I but wish that I had made the whole batch.  DH finished it for a snack in the evening.  Definately will make again...thank you.
173579,33489,2011-06-09,5,Just wonderful.  Perfect in every  way.  Thanks for posting.
173579,18914,2005-02-04,5,This was soooo tasty.  Great garlic and cheese flavor combination. 
209747,18914,2006-02-24,4,This was good. Made with 1/2 c margarine and that was a perfect amount for us. I really liked the black pepper in here- Very different! This is not diet food for sure! Next time I will add some herbs as well to give it a little more flavor. Great recipe
158086,18914,2007-01-21,5,very easy and good garlic bread recipe...we enjoyed it..
8688,18914,2007-04-29,5,"This is what garlic bread is suppose to taste like!  I used 1 cup butter and increased the Parmesan  Cheese to 3/4 cup and eliminated the cheddar cheese entirely .  I baked in oven at 375 degrees until lightly toasted and served with grilled ribeye steaks and a tossed green salad : ) Delicious!  Thank you, SaraFish for this delightful recipe!"
140132,18914,2007-12-30,5,very good.
176615,18914,2008-01-16,5,"Yummy! Used 1/2 c butter and some artisan sourdough bread. A nice change from regular garlic bread, and the cheddar makes this recipe a little different, and a little more versatile. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
323186,18914,2008-09-29,5,"As she says, easy and delicious!    I made it with butter rather than margarine,  and spread it on homebaked Recipe #81211,  very very good!

thanks, Sara!"
171790,18914,2009-02-08,5,"This is a delicious cheesy garlic spread that's quick and easy to make. I used butter instead of margarine and, as a previous reviewer did, overmelted it. Maybe butter melts faster? I would try melting for 20 seconds next time. In any case, the results were great. Made for TOP FAVORITES OF 2008 COOKBOOKS TAG GAME."
369715,18914,2009-02-24,5,Very good. I used 1/2 cup of margarine and didn't add the chopped garlic. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I used sandwich bread as that is all I had. Everyone loved it and I had to make more before my meal was over. Very quick and easy to make and obviously can be used with any type of bread. I even ate this on a slice of bread without being toasted.
305531,18914,2009-03-30,5,"Yummy bread! When I got ready to make this I discovered that my french bread was stale, so made it with Toscana slices instead. Very easy and good. Thanks SaraFish for a nice new keeper. Made for Cookbook Tag."
542159,18914,2011-04-11,5,Wonderful! We enjoyed every last bit. Made as written. Thanks for the post.
286566,18914,2013-05-04,5,"I used butter instead of margarine and used 1 cup of butter and 12 garlic cloves which I put through the garlic press  and omitted the parmesan chees (sorry my mob refer parmesan cheese it as SPEW/VOMIT cheese when it is cooked so used 1 1/4 cups of a sharp cheddar) but otherwise cooked as directed - taking nearly 20 minutes on 225C fan forced  (could possibly have done with a minute or 2 less for perfection) but the end result was oh so good cheesy garlic bread which we all enjoyed immensily.  Thank you SaraFish, made fopr Name that Ingredient tag game."
37449,18914,2013-05-10,5,I scaled down the recipe and enjoyed on whole grain toast. Thanks!
88099,18914,2013-09-02,5,Excellent.  The combination of cheese and garlic were spot on.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for I Recommend tag game.
128473,18914,2016-07-11,5,"Wow, was this ever good. We really loved this simple recipe, it was so quick and easy to make with terrific results. Best of all it uses ingredients that are always found in my pantry and fridge. Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy often. Made for What's on the Menu tag game."
39835,45940,2003-02-23,5,We loved this recipe! My husband said these were the best porkchops we had in five years--tender and juicy and the gravy was great over mashed potatoes. Thanks Buttercup for the perfect way to make porkchops--so easy with fail-proof directions.
8688,45940,2003-03-26,5,"Wonderful, buttercup!  This recipe is a cinch to pop into the crockpot and is ready in only a couple hours!  I used 4 -1"" boneless pork loin chops and served this with Bergy's Penne with Broccoli and Garlic recipe #11647.  We all enjoyed our meal so much!  Thank you, buttercup!!"
169969,45940,2004-12-23,5,"I am going to add to your reviews.... These were so tender and had an incredible flavor! I could not find condensed Chicken broth... so I used regular chicken broth and a bit of condensed cream of chicken. They were FABULOUS! I served them with Apple Sauce (#70097), Macaroni and Cheese (#52799), Buttery Yeast Rolls (#40983)and broccoli. Everyone loved them! My friend that I invited over could not believe that I slaved away all day - she would not believe me that I just popped them in the slow cooker! Thank you!"
140132,45940,2007-08-23,5,"Comfort food at its best.  We really liked this.  I served it with mashed potatoes and buttered peas.  I will be using this recipe again as it was so simple.  
THank you.......Stephanie"
369715,45940,2007-12-17,5,My family really enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly as written other then I used pam in my pan and not oil to cook the chops. This was really good and easy to make. It made a GREAT gravy. I made this with stuffing and everyone enjoyed the gravy over the stuffing. Will be making this again! Thanks buttercup.
95743,45940,2008-02-03,5,Played with the seasoning a bit but loved the cooking technique.
428885,45940,2010-11-04,4,"This is a bang up recipe that will satisfy everyone in your home. The gravy is glorious, and the chops perfection! I used bone-in chops, and served this with mashed potatoes! I added time to my chops in the crock-pot because they weren't quite done at the time indicated, but they sure are tasty! Thanks so much!!"
173579,45940,2012-03-21,5,This was a very tasty meal.  Quick and easy to make.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for posting.
560491,45940,2013-05-29,5,"This is so easy and very tasty too!  Made as written and just added a little fresh cracked pepper to the finished product.  Served with brown rice, green beans and breadsticks.  Made for Name That Ingredient Tag."
4470,13269,2003-05-14,5,Well is this simple? Simply good! I too used the whole pkg of onion soup. cooked it on low for 6 hours and it was perfect. Of course my company thought I was nuts pouring Pepsi over the roast but they didn't complain come dinner time.  Lovely aroma while it is cooking.  I used about 1 1/2 tsp of corn startch to thicken the gravy  Thanks MG great recipe!
173579,13269,2006-09-20,5,This was fantastic!  Great taste.  My whole family just loved it.  So nice and moist.  Will make this many more times.  Thanks for posting.
400708,13269,2007-01-27,3,"This was soooo easy to put together, that alone makes it a winner.  I used a pork roast, and added some potatoes & carrots as I'd seen other reviewers did.  It was good & I would use it again - but can't say it was my favorite.  Plenty of gravy and that was a plus, but my meat was a little dry (could have been the type or size of roast I used) and I think if I'd used the whole pack of onion soup it might have been more to our likeing.  All in all a quick, easy and good recipe that I'd try again when I'm in a hurry.  I think it'd be good with beef also."
140132,13269,2007-02-08,5,"Wow, whoever would have thought that soda would compliment meat so well, but it does.  I used diet pepsi since thats what i had on hand.  The results were a tender and moist roast that was a delite to eat....thanks for a simple yet wonderful recipe....Stephanie"
369715,13269,2009-09-01,3,This was just OK for us. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The pork was very tender but we did not like the taste of the gravy. It was very easy to put together in the morning and it is made with ingredients I normally have on hand. I cooked on low for six hours in my crockpot.
104295,89204,2004-09-05,4,"Pretty good.  I didn't get to eat it hot (had to take my son to the ER instead), but it was pretty good reheated.  I left out the corn because I didn't have any (we don't do canned veggies and I was out of frozen), and used fat free cream cheese.  That did not melt all the way (I did not expect it to), and would probably recommend low-fat instead.  A decent fast dinner.  Thanks."
176615,89204,2005-01-26,5,"I'll just add another 5* review here! Very tender chicken and tasty, too. The beans and corn really stretch this recipe, servings are very generous portions. I served with Perfect Brown Rice recipe #56242. Would be as spicy as your salsa; I used mild so it was fine for the kids. Also used light cream cheese which did not melt into the dish but I didn't care cause it still tasted good. Even my crockpot hating husband liked this one. Thanks, Jen!"
53932,89204,2005-03-13,4,"I was hesitant to try this, but it was much better than I expected. Next time, I think I would add garlic powder, too."
89831,89204,2006-09-26,3,"Sorry to give such a low review on this recipe, the taste was so bland, I even browned the chicken firstly and also sauteed some onions, and garlic and slow-cooked it in my oven, we had to throw away the sauce and just eat the chicken (big waste of ingredients!) my family would not eat it, and they usually eat everything! Oh well everyone has different tastes, I will definately not be making this again, but thanks for sharing anyway...Kitten"
383346,89204,2006-11-28,4,"I used 6 boneless chicken breasts, 19 ounce of black beans, 19 ounce of frozen corn, 340 ml of medium salsa, and a low fat cream cheese.  

I liked it cause it was easy to do and delicious on egg noodles."
140132,89204,2006-12-15,5,"I made this last night for dinner.  Fantastic flavors for something so simple.  I used chili beans instead of black beans, as this was what i had on hand and I used my own homemade salsa.  So simple yet so delicious.  We served this on noodles and was a big hit by all especially DH .  Thank you for a definate keeper....Stephanie"
8688,89204,2007-10-20,4,"A recipe certainly doesn't get much easier than this!  I made as directed, cooking on low until the chicken was tender. Interesting taste combination!  Thanks, Jen Santiago!"
222564,89204,2007-12-23,5,"Great, and the good news for those of us who don't have a crock pot is, that it can be done quite easily without it, as well. 
I cut the chicken in strips, browned it in little oil, added salsa and corn with its liquid and simmered all slowly for 20 minutes. Added the beans, simmered 10 minutes, added cream cheese and just heated through before serving. 
Delish topped with cilantro."
1072593,89204,2009-01-06,5,"""Ye-ah baby""!  Uh, I sounded just like Austin Powers.  This is a complete surprise of a dish.  Tenatively you start our hoping for the best and thinking how in the heck is all this going to work and then....voila!  Whomever created this was genious!"
428885,89204,2009-12-30,5,"Yum, perfect, perfect, perfect! I followed this exactly, and added some sliced black olives to the whole mix, and a couple of frozen cobs of corn, (from our garden this past summer) and the corn added a bit of moisture, and was as smooth as cat fur. :) I didn't have black beans, so instead added white organic Northern beans with some thinly sliced onions. Very delish...and the neighbors came running!"
226863,89204,2010-09-04,4,"I love using my crock pot and like to look for new things to do in it.  This was easy to put together, already had pretty much everything I needed!  When the cook time was over, I shredded my chicken to it would be easy to eat over noodles. Think I'll try it over crushed chips next time.  Thanks for sharing!"
174096,89204,2011-01-08,5,"Easy and enjoyable!  I used a jar of black bean and corn salsa, reduced fat cream cheese, and frozen corn.  We had the first batch served in taco shells served with chopped lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado, and cilantro as toppings.  It was great!  I plan to try the leftovers over rice next.  Thanks for sharing!"
67656,261889,2006-12-14,5,"At the last minute I decided to include stained glass cookies on my holiday trays.  Ddecided that a good cookie recipe was more important than a recipe for that particular variety and choose this one. The cookie was terrific. Light and buttery and not very sweet.  Even better, the final cookie remained tender despite my working it over several times.  This recipe makes a huge batch.  I made one third and still got 3 dozen small (2inch)cookies.  Thanks Kitten."
158086,261889,2009-12-18,5,I just made the frosting but it was perfect...thank you so much..
1072593,261889,2010-04-03,5,"Four batches and the two lifetimes to make these with the grandbabes, I have now even greater respect for the Easter Bunny...and for that matter, Santa Clause, The Tooth Fairy and any other diety dealing with kids."
140132,261889,2011-01-29,5,"Your right, these are the best.  DD#2 needed to take something for her french class and she wanted to make sugar cookies spelling each of their names so I chose your recipe because of the frosting that hardens.  These are fantastic.  The dough mixed up easily and when it came time to roll out it was smooth and easy.  They didn't stick to my countertop and then they baked up so nice.  The frosting was just as easy to put together.  We just loved them.  DD#1 is already planning on using this recipe for her valentines presents to friends.  Thank you so much Kittencalskitchen, you never steer us wrong."
1179225,261889,2011-10-21,5,I wanted to have a little fun today and make some decorated Halloween  cookies. I remembered seeing your recipe for these cookies a while back and couldn't wait to have an occasion to try them. The dough was so easy to make and baked up just perfect. I had to bake mine about 7 minutes. I used large cookie cutters so it was easiest to paint the icing on. I loved that the cookies weren't horribly sweet. Thanks so much for shraring another fantastic recipe.
126440,261889,2014-02-09,5,I think I rolled mine too thin but the flavor and icing turned out great.  Made half a recipe and got 8 of the large 7 inch snowflake cookies.
37449,32204,2004-10-17,5,"Mmmmm good! I used mini marshmallows and chocolate chips. The top looked kind of pockmarked, but the taste was great! I might try the cheesecake topping next. Thanks Karen!"
179133,32204,2004-12-11,5,"I like my brownies gooey and underdone but these seemed to need more than 25 minutes.  I did 28 and took them out but they probably could have gone longer.  Very chocolatey! They were ""Clean Out the Cupboard"" Brownies for me. I used a combination of raisins, mini marshmallows, chocolate chunks and butterscotch chips - totalling 2 cups all together.  Next time I am going to use a combination of Ghirardelli chocolate chips and Reese's peanut butter chips. Yum!"
173579,32204,2006-06-23,4,These were good but not what I had expected.  Thanks for posting.
222564,32204,2006-09-26,5,"Truly, perfectly wonderfull brownie! Rich and moist, chocolaty and dense enough to be easy to cut. With the floaters or without. I used this in a Brownie Trifle recipe and it was great in it, too!"
53932,32204,2006-10-11,5,Another 5 star rating for you!  Loved these.  I added toffee pieces and chocolate chips.  I baked mine a little too long as they didn't look done after 30 minutes but they still taste so good.  Thanks for sharing.
527607,32204,2007-08-06,5,"I don't know whether to kiss you or kick you :lol:  I have made these 3 times in the last week and I live alone. Not one pan lasted longer than 24 hours.

The last version was sprinkling mini marshmallows on top at 18 minutes so they toasted and got gooey... next i might put graham crackers on the bottom of the pan.

omg this recipe should be illegal.  Superb."
104295,32204,2008-01-27,5,Yep.  Very easy and super good.  DH made them once before but didn't review.  I made them with marshmallows and they were fudgy and creamy.  Will be used over and over again.
176615,32204,2008-11-07,5,"Excellent! Made the recipe as stated in a foil-lined dish and no add-ins (this time). Used Penzey's natural cocoa with is richer than a grocery store version like Hershey's, and the brownies were SUPER chocolatey! Easy, too.  A pyrex bowl and a fork is all you need. Will definitely make these again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
126440,32204,2009-06-22,5,"I made these for dessert for Father's Day, I used peppermint extract and green mint chips.  Great Dessert.  DH just loved them."
158086,32204,2010-09-05,5,Such a simple recipe with ingredients you would have on hand and yet they tasted nice and fudgey and yummy....I threw in some white chocolate chips I had on hand...a great fast dessert I served with Moomers Ice Cream for Labor Day.
101823,37336,2005-06-27,4,So easy with a great flavor.  The chicken was very moist even without covering the dish with foil while baking.  Thanks for posting.
173579,37336,2005-06-16,5,This is a great recipe. Not only is it quick and easy but taste fabulous too.  It is so moist you want believe it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  
136997,37336,2006-02-13,4,"I have to admit that the taste was a bit out of the ordinary for me. I'm not used to eating things with warmed mayo. However, my husband inhaled it. He loved it. It turned out very moist and I did bake it for 45 min., only because the breasts were still partially frozen, so it turned out perfect. :) "
280271,37336,2006-03-05,5,The chicken had a delightful flavor and as promised they did melt in your mouth. I followed the recipe to a T and had no problem browning them. Very easy dish to prepare and took no time at all after a busy day at work. Another keeper in my cookbook. Thanks for posting.
53932,37336,2006-09-03,5,I reduced the amount of mayo but used the full amount of everything else.  Great tasting chicken and it was moist!
369715,37336,2008-01-28,4,With all the great reviews I had to try this. My one son hates mayo so wasn't sure how this would go over. I made the recipe as directed other then I used 8 boneless thin cut breast cutlets. I kept the rest of the recipe as written other then I only used 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning salt because of what other reviewers had mentioned. Everyone enjoyed these even my mayo hating son (I never did tell him what was in it :) ) Hubby said I can make these again.
158086,37336,2008-07-15,5,"This was a wonderful recipe...
Nice and moist and flavorful, I used low fat mayo and it was perfect"
1072593,37336,2009-04-01,3,"I've made this twice. The first time I thought that I did something wrong after viewing the many wonderful reviews and ratings. Yes, the chicken was very tender, the aroma was just fabulous and the topping truly was delicious. Easy to prepare is an understatment. I could whip this up with one hand tied behind my back. The drawback was that the breasts tasted poached with the seasonings bound in the topping. Having said that, my husband thought it quite savory.  On this one I left the rating totally up to him."
4470,37336,2010-07-24,0,"Great recipe, neat flavor. I spread the lite mayo on the breasts then sprinkled on the pepper & garlic - I also added a hot & spicy mix.  I held off sprinkling the  cheese on until the breasts were half cooked.  Then sprinkled it on and it was golden when the chicken was cooked  - We enjoyed our dinner thanks"
166642,37336,2010-07-27,5,This chicken is the BEST! It really does melt in your mouth. Each of my family members went back for extra so I'm happy that I made extra. I covered the chicken breasts in the mayonnaise mixture rather than just brushing it on top. I didn't change a thing with the ingredients although I used 6 chicken breasts instead of just four without having to change the amount of ingredients. I'm amazed how you wouldn't even know there is mayonnaise on this chicken. My kids thought it was a breading and I thought it tasted like it too. Truly delicious and going into my tried and true recipe book. Thanks so much for sharing!
176615,37336,2012-04-14,5,Good! Super easy for a weeknight meal. Moist and flavorful. Even my son who doesn't care for chicken ate and enjoyed. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
140132,37336,2012-10-27,5,These really are melt in your mouth.  I made these for my family along with noodles and a veggie.....GREAT meal.  Thank you so much for sharing this simple yet delicious recipe with us.  We loved it.
428885,37336,2013-12-06,5,"Made today, and found this to be everything it said it was. Easy, tasty, and had no problem getting this to brown up to perfection. I used breast tenderloins, so they were coated on all sides, making them even more delicate and delicious. Thanks for a lovely recipe."
169969,177558,2006-08-11,5,This was by far the easiest way to roast corn yet. I loved how the silk just peeled off with the husk! The corn really retained its flavor and was delicious. The time was right on for our ears. Thank you Pot Pie!!
89831,177558,2006-08-23,5,"I roast many other veggies, why not corn! the flavor in the corn is so much sweeter done this way, try this everyone! great method PotPie! thanks for sharing...Kitten:) "
53932,177558,2006-09-03,5,Incredibly easy and tasty.  I wish I had known about this method of cooking long ago as the corn tastes wonderful.  
37449,177558,2008-06-25,5,Thank you for an easy recipe that has such good results! Yum!
486725,177558,2008-07-01,5,"Wow! This is the perfect way to make corn on the cob. Much tastier than boiled or microwaved, and easy too. The only trick is getting the husks off while hot, you might want to let them cool a few minutes. Our new favorite way to make corn!"
386585,177558,2009-05-12,5,Another rave review from a Groovy GastroGnome for ZWT5!  I made this exactly as directed and the corn came out perfect (and the silk was so easy to remove).  No need to ever make corn any other way!  Thanks for posting this.
140132,177558,2009-07-30,5,This is worth all 5 stars + 100 more!  No more standing in front of the garbage can cleaning corn! Yea!  No more boiling the corn getting a steam facial! Yea!  This corn turned out so tender and cooked to perfection.  I cooked it exactly the 30 minutes and it was perfect.  I also stacked the corn ears on top of each other.  I had a dozen ears and they all didn't fit on the bottom so I put 3 ears on top of the others and it worked perfectly.  Thank you so much for showing me this really easy and so much better way of preparing corn.
176615,177558,2010-05-16,5,Really simple method which produces perfect corn. Made this along with recipe #8701 and Recipe #14023 for a wonderful meal. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
1179225,177558,2011-07-07,5,Wow...perfect and so easy! Our's needed to stay in the oven about 5 extra minutes. Thanks for posting.
179133,66703,2005-07-23,5,"These are wonderful cookies! Soft and buttery with a great texture. A nice dough to work with - doesn't stick all over your hands when rolling into balls. Also tastes really good raw - in fact, I couldn't keep out of it after mixing it up! (oops!) My batch yielded closer to 4.5 dozen cookies - but I'm not complaining! :) Thanks!"
89831,66703,2006-02-04,4,"These cookies were good but definately not the best, I really think that the large amount shortening took away lots of flavor from the cookie. I might try these using half butter and half shortening next time. Thanks, Kittencal:)"
173579,66703,2006-05-01,5,Great cookies! Some of the best that I have ever eaten.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  
158086,66703,2007-08-16,5,What a great cookie recipe this turned out to be...I thought I had a good one until I tried this one...Sending these out in a box to my son who lives in Florida as he misses homemade goodies...these will travel well...thanks
140132,66703,2011-03-07,5,These really do melt in your mouth.  I made mine a bit small so I got about 4 1/2 dozen.  We loved these cookies.  Thank you for sharing these easy cookies that take no time at all to whip up.
104295,77397,2006-06-15,5,"There is a reason this has over 100 reviews!  I used whole wheat pastry flour and fat free half and half.  For the melted butter I used some of that stuff that comes in a spray bottle.  It all tasted great and had the texture we enjoy.  Thanks for another great one, Kittencal!"
107135,77397,2006-06-23,5,wow kitten this is the bomb.dee
67656,77397,2006-07-09,5,"This is one of those go to recipes that every chef should have in their arsenal.  I made a half batch in a 9 inch square pan.  Added the egg as suggested as well as a cup of blueberries.  The fruit, sugar and butter created these wonderful cavities in the light cake that were just oozing with flavor.  The variations here are endless adding apples or pears, nuts or different extracts.  Yummy! Thanks Kitz. "
88099,77397,2006-07-14,5,OMG this is so easy to prepare and tasted just wonderful.  I used your glaze to top this off.  The girls at work will love this.  Thanks for another winner Kitz
140132,77397,2007-01-30,4,This is a good recipe.  I made this on Sunday for our brunch.  We enjoyed this very much. I didn't add any glaze and we didn't miss it at all. Very good sweet treat........thank you   Stephanie
527607,77397,2007-07-01,5,"Came across this at midnight and had to make it right away.  Because it was late,  it didnt occur to me the wet top was due to drizzled butter on brown suger :D and i overcooked it.  The baking powder was old or the pan to big because it was thin as well. STILL great.

Next time i will pay attention to it cooking lol and swirl topping in as well.

My solution to the left overs, since it was overcooked it got a little hard will be to use it for an amazing french toast.  The topping was welded to the top (not in a bad way)  so won't fall to pieces when dipped.

Any problems i had with the recipe were mine, the flavor was superb though and once i cook it properly then i won't have leftovers for french toast!"
158086,77397,2007-10-17,5,"This was a great, fast dessert recipe....I used a 9 X 13 pan and had no problems....I also used splenda for baking and it turned out perfect."
383346,77397,2008-01-20,5,"Yummy!  I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup.  It's enough for us.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla.  I added 1 cup of blueberries thawed to the dough.  For the topping, I used only 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Thanks Kit :) Made for Zaar Star Game."
176615,77397,2008-01-21,5,"Yummy! and so much easier than cinnamon rolls in the morning :) Made as directed, including recipe #120835 and the family loved it. The icing was delicious, but would certainly be good without it, too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
400708,77397,2008-02-17,5,"Kittencal you've done it again.  This was so easy and wonderful.  Thanks to you my DH thinks I'm wonderful.  This was so easy, had it in the oven in just a matter of minutes and served warm for a special breakfast.  Had the taste of fresh cinnamon buns without the work.  Glad I followed your advice and used the large pan as it rose wonderful and the bigger pan was needed.  I also topped it with chopped walnuts, added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and used your recipe #120835 to top.  It was way to much for just the two of us (though we could have eaten it all) so sliced into individual servings and froze.  When I took them out of the freezer, let them come to room temp. and they were just as good as when first made.  Love these and will be making them a lot from now on."
222564,77397,2008-04-03,5,"All five stars for easy preparation of cinnamon bun type of cakey thing, lovely!"
173579,77397,2009-02-22,5,Great tasting recipe.  So easy to throw together.  Very nice cinnamon flavor.  Thanks for such a tasty treat.
8688,77397,2008-05-09,5,"This was by no means a ""Flop"" at my house! What wonderful flavor! So simple to prepare :) The aroma that filled my house brought everyone to the kitchen to find out what was in the oven! Kittencal, you know I will be making this one again!! Thanks so much for the wonderful breakfast recipe! -- posted Sept 11, 2005 *** Just an update to let you know this recipe remains a favorite in my house! I love to add in an egg for great texture, the almond extract, a few sliced almonds on top and Kittencal's recipe for Really Easy and Good Creamy White Glaze Recipe #120835 at a pourable consistency to top off the Flop : )"
197023,77397,2008-09-02,5,"I really enjoyed making this and - because it was so delicious - I enjoyed eating it even more.  Unbelievably easy to make!  I went with the almond extract option, used less sugar (about 3/4 cup: a personal taste preference) and included a Fuji apple sliced and some cinnamon in step 3: and I added walnuts to the topping.  Next time, I'll add 2 apples.  Great recipe, as 390 Zaar chefs have already stated!  Made for Zaar Stars Tag: a super-star recipe!"
171790,77397,2008-09-18,5,"I love quick and easy recipes like this one, especially when the results are so delicious. I added a chopped apple to the mixture and baked it in two pans, one topped with chopped walnuts and the other without nuts. I also included the optional egg."
428885,77397,2008-09-25,5,"Does this ever stop? Stop! I can't take another great recipe. No just kidding. As per usual, Kit this is da' bomb of goodness. Just so delicious, I think the cows faces are pressed against the window just trying to get a sniff of the extravaganza. I followed this exactly as written and so delicate in taste you want to believe it is light as a feather. I used the egg option, (egg substitute - 2 tablespoons) and just did exactly as indicated. Kitten you are always on top of your recipes and this is another great one. Oh yes! I added some chopped fresh apples from the orchard. Made for *I Recommend* tag game. Fall 2008."
226863,77397,2008-10-06,5,"This was really good. My son loved it. I added the white glaze as suggested. It made it a little too sweet for me, so next time I may decrease the sugar in the cake so that I can still use the tastey glaze. I made this for I Recommend Tag Game. Thanks for the recipe!"
1072593,77397,2008-12-17,3,"I've been eyeing this recipe for years and tis the season for baking... Firstly, I mixed dry ingredients then added this to the wet ingredients as suggested, using a light hand. After baking, it was apparent the butter along with the brown sugar, sunk towards the bottom making it rather gooey. Now, don't get me wrong, this may be a good thing for many. I also made half a recipe of Kittencal's Easy Creamy White Glaze, which was more than enough. I'm uncertain if the flop's richness is a result of using half-and-half and egg or the addition of the glaze, but the combination was almost over-the-top sweet."
482376,77397,2009-12-27,5,"Adding another 5 star review for this delight! I made this as an extra gift to give to my mom at Christmas, because she loves cinnamon buns/cake. This was super simple to put together and I had all of the ingredients on hand. How wonderful is that?! I used 2 8-inch tins (disposable kind for ease of gift giving) - and the batter filled them both up beautifully. What I think is really cool about this recipe, is that the brown sugar/cinnamon topping kind of seeps down into the cake as it bakes up. I didn't do the glaze but next time I will. It looks fabulous! ~Made for KK's Forum~"
424680,77397,2010-02-08,5,Made this recipe pretty much as given here & we have a WONDERFUL TASTE EXPERIENCE ~ I did use the vanilla flavoring in the cake batter & was definitely generous in the topping with the cinnamon AND brown sugar! Also opted for the walnuts rather than the almonds! A most wonderful keeper! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Cookbook tag]
1179225,77397,2011-03-20,4,Very good! I think it was better the next day. Next time I'll toast the walnuts. So easy and quick. Perfect snack cake.Thanks for posting!
386585,77397,2012-01-18,4,"This is a nice reliable coffee cake, nothing fancy but way too easy!  I made this exactly as posted, adding the egg, topping with walnuts and baking in a 13x9-inch pan.  Couldn't have been easier!"
560491,77397,2012-11-28,5,Made this as an afternoon snack cake.  I made 1/2 the recipe in one 9-inch cake pan.  I left out the nuts for DSs and it was still very good.  Moist and the topping gave it a nice sweetness.  Made for I Recommend Holiday Tag.
176615,26217,2005-02-13,5,"I knew this would be wonderful, so I made a double batch and froze a good bit to enjoy later. Oh, it smelled good while it was simmering on the stove! The only change I made was to use 2 lbs of extra lean ground beef in my double batch. Adding the mushrooms at the end was delicious, one of those, ""I can't believe I never thought to do this"" moments. A wonderful recipe as well because it used ingredients I had on hand. The whole family loved it! Thanks, Bev, for a fabulous recipe!"
158086,26217,2006-05-21,5,This was a fabulous spaghetti sauce recipe. I added 1/2 cup red wine and a couple teaspoons of splendra..and let it simmer slow on stove all day...was wonderful...
140132,26217,2009-09-27,4,this is very good.  I could make this and just dip bread into it.....so good.  Thank you for sharing.
53932,26217,2010-02-25,5,"Excellent spaghetti sauce.  I didn't have enough time to simmer it the full time on the first day, but simmered it longer before serving the next day and it was so delicious."
166642,26217,2011-04-04,5,"This is very delicious spaghetti sauce! I made it just as stated and it turned out perfectly. My family enjoyed it immensely. I had plenty left over so I am freezing it to use at a later date for lasagna or stuffed shells. Thanks for sharing another wonderful recipe, Bev."
383346,26217,2011-07-08,4,I added the mushrooms in the sauce at the beginning.  Next time I'll add more veggies to give more taste.  It was too tomato taste.  Maybe a little bit of sugar would help.  Tonight I used it in recipe#289942 and it was great.  So maybe only a little bit of red wine added to it would add flavor.  Thanks Bev :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
88099,26217,2013-07-27,5,This was a great sauce.    Thanks for sharing.
37449,76930,2004-01-07,5,"I picked this for the chef of the day game and so glad I did! I did cut back  on the sesame oil, and served the chicken seperately. I cooked veggies on the side(mushroom, carrot,celery,zucchini, broccoli and onion). I used some of the marinade for the vegetables. Thanks Mirj for a wonderful dish that my whole family liked!"
101823,76930,2004-02-08,5,"OK...so add my hubby and I to the list of Funky Chicken devotees.  We really liked this dish.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I cut the amount of sesame oil in half for the noodles.  I also didn't decide to make this until late in the afternoon, and therefore, cut my chicken breasts into strips before marinating (to allow more surface area to absorb the flavor).  We preferred the noodles warm and I added about 1 1/2 cups of thawed frozen peas to the mix.  Hubby thought that steamed broccoli or other stir-fry veggies would be a good addition, too.  I had to stop hubby after his second bowl; I wanted leftovers for my lunch this week!"
4470,76930,2004-04-03,5,"Reading over the reviews it appears that people either loved the recipe or were not too fond of it  Well I loved the whole recipe . I cut the recipe back to two servings - no problem.   I did as suggested, cut back on the Sesame oil for the spaghetti ,  used black sesame seeds, and Splenda in stead of sugar. I had chicken thighs (boneless) on hand so used them instead of breasts.  I warmed thepasta to just above room temp before serving  and had the chicken hot  with steamed asparagus on the side.  Thanks Mirjam for a great recipe - yep we inhaled it!."
133174,76930,2004-09-19,5,"Had dinner guests and served this wonderful dish.  We know understand about the ""inhale"" part.  I did toast the seasame seeds before using and used turbinado sugar in the noodles.  Used angel hair pasta for the spaghettini.  Used about 2 times the amount of scallions (personal taste) and a reduced sodium soy sauce.  Because I love ginger, I used a little more than the recipe called for and the chicken was sliced before putting in the marinade.  Also, I served the noodles at room temperature and they absorbed the sauce nicely.  This was a hit with everyone.  Thanks for sharing."
176615,76930,2006-01-23,5,"Super! and made even better because picky DH and the three picky boys ALL ate and enjoyed it. That NEVER happens thus this recipe merits ten stars! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. After school hours are hectic ones for us, and this is great since most of the prep is done earlier. Easy and tasty enough to serve to guests. Thanks, Mirj!"
158086,76930,2006-04-10,5,THis was a big hit at my oriental sunday dinner....they ate it all up...
140132,76930,2007-04-19,5,"We really enjoyed this.  I loved the noodles.....mmmmmm.  This chicken had great flavor as did the noodles.  I have never had sesame noodles before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I am loving this.  This recipe is very easy also, bonus....lol  Thank you for such a delicious addition to our asian menus.....Stephanie"
280271,76930,2007-04-23,5,"I just had to make this after all the recent reviews. It seemed that everyday someone was eating this!!! I felt left out! So off I went, and it sure was tasty. I had to agree with just about everyone that this is worthy of 5+ stars. I also figured out that there is only 9 WW points!! Thanks Mirj for posting..."
136997,76930,2007-08-06,5,"Fabulous recipe! I was just a bit concerned about the amount of soya sauce being used, but it worked out fine. I did cut back on the sesame oil and used honey as my sweetner. I also didn't have the chicken breasts, so I used some legs I needed to use up. Marinated 2 hours and then baked them off in a 350 degree oven for aprox. 1 hour. Perfect combination of flavors. :)"
1179225,76930,2009-09-28,4,"Really good! I thought it was a little salty and oily, but the flavor was really yummy. Next time I'll use less oil for the noodles (a little less than 1/4 cup) and low sodium soy sauce. Thank you for posting this easy and delicious recipe."
226863,76930,2013-08-15,3,"I wasn&#039;t crazy about the noodles. I found them a bit too sweet.  But I really enjoyed the chicken.  This is very easy to make, which is also a plus.  Thanks for sharing!"
37449,27144,2004-03-26,5,"This cake turned out nice and light and of course, yummy! I didn't let it cool long enough and turned it upside down and it fell apart a little, but no problem! We just ate it right up anyway! Thanks for a healthier way to fix a chocolate fix!"
296809,27144,2006-10-18,5,"Oh my, this is the richest & most decadent cake I have ever made or tasted. I used the Betty Crocker Super Moist Devil's Food Cake Mix & DH said it was like Chocolate Heaven! So easy to make & such a wonderful outcome. We are on a trip in the U.S. right now, but I will not waste a minute fixing this for our friends when we get back to Iceland. A real winner! Thx for posting this recipe. Yum!"
140132,27144,2007-01-30,5,oh my goodness.  This is heavenly.  I made this the other night for dessert and my kids went nuts.  It is to die for. Very chocolatey but so so good.  I loved the glaze as it seemed to soak into the cake as it sat....yummmy.  I didn't change a thing to the recipe and never will.  But i will be making this again......Stephanie
158086,27144,2007-10-18,5,Wonderful cake! I made it with 50% less sugar box cake mix and sugar free pudding....turned out great...
8688,27144,2008-04-16,5,"We just loved this cake!  So moist and chocolaty!  I made this using Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips to add just that added touch (plus, it was all I had on hand ;) ). I also doubled the chocolate glaze.  Otherwise, made exactly as directed.  There isn't one thing I would change about this recipe.  Perfect as is.  Thanks so much, CCinSC!"
386585,27144,2009-02-17,5,This was absolutely fabulous.  I made it exactly as instructed and was in chocolate heaven.  I will definitely be making this again!
8688,221743,2008-12-13,5,"This is the most tender and juiciest chicken I have ever tasted!  I used  a 5 pound chicken and adjusted the cooking time accordingly, otherwise preparing the recipe as written using the juice of 1 whole lemon and adding the cayenne to the seasoning mix. and also using the onion inside the chicken cavity.  The will become my standard roast chicken recipe!  Thank you so much, Kittencal for always being there with the perfect recipe!"
140132,221743,2009-03-24,5,"This is a very good recipe that had great flavor and the chicken stayed nice and juicy on the inside.  As always Kittencal you came through for my family with this winner of a chicken dinner.  I love the fact that you put the onions in the center.....so good.  Thank you for posting, as I will most definately make this again."
56003,221743,2009-12-31,5,"Just wanted to add my kudos to the rest.  Very, very tasty!  I used a stand that I use for beer can chicken.  The photo is kind of amusing...it looks like she's sitting on the pot!!:D"
104295,19424,2007-04-07,5,"These are tremendous muffins.  I wanted to do some commando baking (a large amount) so I used all my frozen bananas and quadrupled the recipe.  Easy to do.  I used part fat free vanilla yogurt and part skim milk to sub. in for the buttermilk.  I use a white/wheat flour combo, and I was liberal with the mini chips.  Otherwise I stayed the same.  Love how moist these are even without added fat.  The only issue I had, and it is because of my oven and my attempt to make this in such quantity, is that you really have to check and see if they are done.  They start browning and I would think they were done, but when I took them out there were still underdone.  I usually like my muffins to not get brown (because often in low fat muffins that means they will be dry) but these need a good brown color to be fully cooked.  Something I'll make again.  Thanks!"
169969,19424,2007-09-25,5,These are great muffins. They are sweeter then I thought they would be and were done a little bit before the time stated (both definite bonuses!).  I used the mini chocolate chips and made them for our 5 year olds lunch box! He loves them! Thank you!
140132,19424,2009-06-22,4,"I made these muffins for my family this weekend and they loved them.  I had three bananas that had gotten too ripe for us and this recipe was perfect.  I loved the addition of chocolate chips, not too many, just right.  Thank you for a nice muffin to serve my family."
158086,19424,2009-07-15,5,Boy oh boy these turned out fabulous....I did use splenda for baking instead of real sugar and added a tsp. of baking powder to give them a little more lift...they turned out perfect...oh i did double the recipe as I had quite a few bananas to use up...
1179225,19424,2011-07-07,4,These are really good low fat muffins. I hate the thought of using all that butter in my usual recipe. The baking time was a little off for me. I should have pulled them out at about 25 mins. Thanks so much for posting.
383346,19424,2013-06-18,5,These muffins are so yummy.  I used 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  Thanks Manda :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game
41578,82102,2004-05-19,5,"We really enjoyed this chicken, KittenCal.  I only made 3 chicken breasts which is plenty of chicken for us.  The chicken was moist and juicy and the breading was fabulous.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, (yep, hubby LOVES garlic.) The cheese combination with the bread crumbs is to die for.   I served this meal with your Greek Salad.  What a great dinner we had thanks to you.  You are my idol.
:-)
 "
128473,82102,2004-07-13,5,"Kittencal thanks so much for recommending this wonderful recipe. It was amazing. The chicken is to die for. It was so easy to make and turned out moist, tender and crisp. Needless to say we loved it. Thanks so much for sharing."
173579,82102,2005-02-11,5,"Excellent recipe.  Very cheesy.  My family liked this very much.  Keep bringing on those wonderful recipes, Kittencal."
158086,82102,2005-08-11,5,This recipe was great!  I have to agree to double the butter and breadcrumb mixtures but other than that it was amazing!
169969,82102,2006-08-09,5,"Everyone enjoyed this recipe. Since the cheddar was already grated I threw all the breading ingredients into the food processor and let it whirl. This really made the ingredients evenly distributed and the cheese a finer grate. This dish is also surprisingly kid friendly, as our 4 year old ate every last bite. I had a good amount of the garlic butter left over and poured it on top of the breasts...next time I will cut down on the amount of butter. I served it with corn on the cob and zucchini oven fries. Thank you Kitz for yet another wonderful dinner. "
166642,82102,2007-03-19,5,"This is absolutely outstanding, Kit! I would give it 10 stars if I could. It is most definitely restaurant quality. I was going to halve the recipe but then realized there were 8 thin chicken breasts instead of 4 so I just made the whole recipe. Boy am I glad I did! We each had two chicken breasts because it was that delicious. Even my youngest pickiest eater had second helpings. I only used 1 T of the garlic, which was good, but next time I am definitely going with 2 T. I didn't have to pound the chicken breasts since mine were thin and they cooked in exactly 30 minutes. The breading is fabulous and of course the garlic/butter mixture makes this dish. I am going to serve this for dinner the next time I have guests. Thanks!"
140132,82102,2007-11-12,4,Really good recipe.  These held there juices in and tasted great.  They were easy to prepare and had good flavor....thank you Kittencal for another yummy recipe....Stephanie
136997,82102,2007-12-03,5,"Oh wow Carol! This is awesome chicken. So moist and flavorful. My husband loved it, as did I of course. The only thing I did was to half the recipe. :)"
226863,82102,2008-12-07,5,Very good!  It was very moist and tastey.  I will definitely make this again.
452355,82102,2009-03-13,4,"This was an easy to prepare, tasty, garlicky chicken dish.  I actually thought my breasts were a little dry despite following the 35 minute guidelines.   We  served it with a side of asparagus."
482376,82102,2009-12-28,5,"Easy and delicious! I do something similar to this but it doesn't include the cheddar cheese nor does it call for as much garlic. I loved this version. The chicken remains tender while the coating crisps up nicely. It's full of flavor, too. Thanks for another great recipe!"
126440,82102,2012-04-14,4,Loved the garlic flavor but didn't get as crisp as I thought it should.  Cooked it on a rack so maybe if I use less butter next time it would work.
286566,82102,2013-05-16,4,"Garlic lovers would unite and though I loved as per recipe 2 of our other diners thought it could have done without the cheese in the crumb mix and just sprinkle over top in the  last 5 minutes of cooking (I did both so may have overpowered and only used sharp cheddar cheese as my mob hate parmesan when cooked, they refer to it as spew cheese).  Thank you Kittencalskitchen made for I Recommend tag game and recommended by Breezermom."
400708,82102,2014-03-09,4,Love all of your recipes so decided to give this a try.  It was so easy &amp; very good.  I placed mine on a rack over the pan to bake &amp; this gave a lovely crisp coating with no mushy bottom.  Followed your suggestion of topping with marinara sauce &amp; mozzarella cheese in the last few minutes.  Served over fettuccine noodles &amp; served with a fresh garden salad.  Lovely dinner in a short amount of time
280271,82102,2018-08-15,5,With so many yummy reviews you can't go wrong with this dish...it's easy and tasty...thanks for sharing your recipe...
89831,82486,2004-12-14,5," Kitty this cake was totally wonderful! I made mine in a Bundt pan with 5 very ripe bananas that I had in my freezer. I omitted the nuts and threw in some tiny chocolate chips instead, I also cut the sugar down by a couple of tablespoons, as the bananas and chocolate chips added enough sugar to the cake. This cake is a high riser, almost thought it would run over the bundt pan when baking, but it turned out just fine LOL! Dh and DS had this for dessert tonight, and I sent half of the cake home with my son, he loves banana cake, it is one of his favorites. PK thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe....Kitten:)"
157425,82486,2005-04-04,5,Enjoyed this a lot and will be making quite often.
140132,82486,2008-06-12,5,"Excellent flavor.  This is very moist bread.  I made this for brunch last week and we loved them.  Thank you for posting, we will be repeating often."

173579,82486,2013-07-07,5,Very tasty Banana Nut Bread.  It was so moist and yummy.  Thanks for posting.
1072593,82486,2018-03-06,5,"256 comments! I can clearly see I arrived late to the party so I ate it all...as in, by MYSELF. In memory of this tragedy I request no moment of silence."
400708,82486,2018-11-10,5,"Moist and full of flavor, very nice bread"
6357,47195,2002-11-29,5,"Uncle Bill, these are wonderful! My brother wanted something for an evening snack this evening and he insisted on getting potatoes! That split second I decided I would try out this recipe. I did and I'm so glad I did that. I used 3 medium-sized potatoes(peeled and thinly sliced), 1/4 tsp. black pepper and 1/2 tsp. salt. I mixed it all nicely together in a microwave bowl and microwaved these chips on HIGH power level for 7 minutes 29 seconds to be precise! Please note that I did not apply any oil to my bowl and these chips were wonderful - they did not stick to the bowl, though I admit, they did stick to each other, but that was fine, really. They scooped out beautifully and I served them to bro with some tomato ketchup on the side. He was really delighted when I told him that these are no oil French fries! He was really thrilled on hearing that. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. No more of the French fries on the stove with oil and the mess of draining the excess oil on kitchen paper napkins. We'll go with this recipe hereafter! A thousand thanks!"
104295,47195,2004-06-22,5,"Like this needs a 76th review, but I want to chime in that I too loved these.  We made plain chips and Old Bay chips and they were great.  We tried salt and vinegar and were not very successful in getting a strong vinegar taste.  Next time I may soak them in vinegar.  But a great low-fat snack.  Perfect for those of us on Weight Watchers!"
53932,47195,2005-07-04,5,"Yes indeed, these are just great!  I tried them with Tony Chacere's, with Cavender's Greek Seasoning and with plain old salt.  They tasted good no matter what I sprinkled them with.  I served them with Pan Fried Onion Dip (#126209).   Thank you."
17803,47195,2007-04-14,5,"Stop bringing those bags of greasy potato chips into your home!  These are easily made using a mandoline and are GREAT TASTING.  Thank you William for sharing this recipe with us.  We will be making these homemade fat-free chips from now on.  No more store bought for this household.  I can't wait for our next family get together, as I'll be making these for everyone to try!!!"
428885,47195,2007-10-03,5,"A wonderful little potato chip. I used red skinned potatoes, and a microwave bacon tray. I put some crunchy sea salt just for a bit of pizazz and these turned out perfectly. The trick is to follow ""Uncle Bills"" wonderful, precise, and very informative instructions. Don't rub oil on them, frown at them, laugh at them or jump up and down. Just put in the ol' microwave, and watch away. Transformation in progress, and presto, you have a bowl of healthy and tasty chips. Thank you so very much, Uncle Bill~"
41578,47195,2007-12-27,5,"We had the next door neighbors over and I said, ""Lets make potato chips"".  I got funny looks from everyone, but when I pulled out the ingredients, they new I was serious, ha, ha.  Anyway, we had an absolute ball making and eating these great chips.  What a fun evening.  I used parchment paper and it worked out great.  We experimented with a variety of spices and herbs.  Great fun and thanks for sharing, Uncle Bill."
140132,47195,2009-03-24,5,These are YUMMY!!!  I loved them and tried different seasonings on them.  I will make these again for lunches.  Thank you so much for posting.
424680,47195,2009-07-17,5,"OUTSTANDING, & SO EASY, TOO! I actually had a good size group munching from my finger food buffet, so I'd tripled this recipe & that worked out just great! I used lemon pepper mixed with a little bit more garlic powder & these were a really big hit! Thanks for this GREAT KEEPER RECIPE! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Zaar Cookbook tag]"
107135,47195,2012-03-23,5,for Candace my dietitian who's awesome
126440,47195,2013-05-30,5,"Made half a recipe but each batch took 71/2 min. as I had used my food processor to slice the potatoes.  It is 2mm, I believe.  May have to get a different blade so they are thinner.  Serving with Recipe #34683 later today."
89831,46780,2005-11-06,4,"This is a good cheesecake, although I felt is needed more spices than stated, I did increase the spices but next time I will increase them even more, and mabey add in some cloves, I also increased the vanilla by a teaspoon, the texture was pretty good. A must topped with whipped cream. Thanx for sharing!...Kittencal:)"
8688,46780,2007-11-22,5,"Absolutely incredible!  There's no reason to go to Cheesecake Factory when you can make this so easily and fresh at home.  I made this for our Thanksgiving supper 2007.  Thank you, Michele7 : )"
126440,46780,2009-12-19,5,I have made this a few times now and it is wonderful.  This time I added more cinnamon as many have suggested. I used low fat cream cheese and is has great flavor and is so creamy.
140132,46780,2010-09-20,5,"So decadent.  I made this last night and we loved loved loved it.  It was fairly easy to prepare and it tasted so good.  My family thinks I'm the best....thank you for that.  I will make again, as you mentioned around Thanksgiving would be wonderful."
89831,73166,2003-11-22,5,"Hi Amanda...made your chili last night for dinner. I served it with fresh homemade French bread and a dollup of sour cream on top in the bowl....WOW....what a great recipe for chili, followed the directions as posted, but left out the cubed sirloin, and made it with just ground beef, also I added one can of crushed tomatoes, cause I was worried that I would'nt have enough for my guests, it turned our amazingly delicious, we all had seconds, and my guests just raved about it, I had to hand over your recipe to my girlfriend, she was so impressed....Both myself and my DH are chili lovers, and I am always searching for good recipes for chili....well, this is certainly a real winner...thank you Amanda for your wonderful recipe:-) :-)"
280271,73166,2006-02-18,5,Awsomely Good!! All those different flavors dancing around in your month was wonderful. I took leftovers to work and had some of the girls taste it. No one could figure out what was in it. It was rated 5 stars there also.
95743,73166,2006-04-09,0,"This definitely is a different chili.  Dh liked it well enough while I didn't care for it at all. I did substitite turkey for the ground beef but otherwise followed the recipe.  Guess that's why they make chocolate, vanilla and strawberry."
58104,73166,2007-03-23,0,This Chili recipe is very close to my recipe #50389 I just use four different kinds of beans. It must be good!
140132,73166,2009-02-22,4,"I made this for one of those cold nights....brrrr.  This is really a good chili, very complex flavor.  I will make this when we want to serve chili to guests, can't wait for them to try it.  Thank you for posting."
176615,73166,2009-12-08,4,"Good! Made this recipe on a very cold day with recipe #263660 and it really hit the spot. Very mild, not spicy, tomatoey, and definitely sweet. I'd seen this recipe on AllRecipes where it has nearly 900 reviews; that recipe calls for chili powder rather than chili sauce, so I assumed the chili sauce was a typo. Used 4 large jalapenos, good Penzey's chili powder, and some wonderful organic ground beef and sirloin steak. We enjoyed the dish, but it's very different from chili I grew up on which was much spicier. I've never added beans, but love what that does nutritionally and as it cooked down, the beans (I drained them)really thicken up the dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
400708,73166,2010-02-02,4,"I been saving this recipe for some time waiting to try and yesterday was just the cold, dreary day to give it a try.  The only differance I made was to use chili powder instead of sauce as that's what we had on hand and really enjoyed this.  The taste was differant from what we usually expect from chile but very nice.  DH felt it was a little too sweet (I liked it) so would probably leave out the brown sugar next time.  By the way, the directions didn't mention when to add the sugar - so I just added it with the spices.  We served with recipe#410289 but think next time I'd use a simple corn bread recipe.  We did enjoy this, specially with the beef added to the regular ground beef."
226863,73166,2013-01-02,4,"This is so sweet!  Tooth-achingly sweet! I made according to the recipe, although I only used 2 cans of beans...the poster actually said she cut the bean amount, so I felt that was okay on my first try on this recipe.  Maybe the extra beans take away from the sweetness, but I have always enjoyed a ""meat"" chili, not a ""bean"" chili, so tried for that. I enjoyed the mix of cubed sirloin and ground meat.....that is what I usually use.  I also do not use chili powder, basically making my own.  However, this chili is extremely sweet.  I can't say it is awful, but my mouth recoiled when I took a bite....it was expecting ""chili"", not candied baked beans.  This recipe is edible....but it doesn't taste like chili to me.  I'm giving this a 3 star, because it doesn't taste horrible, just not what you expect from chili.  I'm sad, because this is the first ""new"" chili recipe I've tried in years.....going back to my own tried and true recipe.***Letting this chili sit overnight lets the heat increase and temper the sweetness.  So I'm changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars."
136997,99476,2006-10-27,4,"Very easy to throw together. I think the next time though, I'll use fresh garlic as I found that it needed just a wee bit of something. :)"
158086,99476,2007-01-15,5,"Great, great recipe...made this along with bourbon chicken for our family get together dinner and got rave reviews....easy and fast.
thanks"
140132,99476,2007-01-30,5,I have been on a chinese food kick and this is one my son requested.  It was very easy to put together and very good.  We enjoyed this. I served this with fried rice.  Thank you for a keeper.....Stephanie
226863,99476,2009-04-23,5,"So easy and sooo good!  Even my picky DS that will only eat broccoli covered in cheese loved this.  This goes in my ""keeper"" cookbook!  Thanks for sharing the great recipe.  Made for All New Zaar Cookbook Tag!"
126440,99476,2010-02-23,5,"Loved this easy recipe.  I added sesame oil, ginger and sriracha to the marinate for flank steak and red pepper, mushrooms to the veggies.   
Served with Recipe #72124 and rice."
1179225,99476,2012-10-31,5,"MmmmMmmm....This hit the spot! This is a very different recipe than what I usually use for beef stir fry. I usually add sherry and sesame oil,leaving out the brown sugar. This was a nice mild sauce that glazed the meat to perfection. Chuck steak was just the right cut of meat, it was soooo tender. This meal was simple to put together and delicious. I'll be making this again. Thanks for posting the recipe."
176615,99476,2016-03-07,5,Good and super easy. I doubled the sauce and added a few shakes of crushed red pepper. Thanks for the recipe!
89831,14979,2005-08-28,5,"What a super delicious pie Lennie! So many wonderful reviews and now I know why. I made two of these tonight for my guests for Sunday dinner, there was not a piece left and a few people even had seconds. I added in a small amount of banana extract to the cream mixture, after step nine.... I also covered it with a film of plastic wrap while cooling. My guests really enjoyed this pie, thanks for another keeper Lennie!...Kitten:)"
173579,14979,2005-11-01,5,This was excellent.  So smoothe and creamy.  My guest said it was very good.  Will be making this with the coconut very soon.  Thanks for posting such a wonderful recipe.
324390,14979,2007-03-29,5,Easy and good! We enjoyed this for my dad's 65th birthday.
140132,14979,2009-09-29,3,"The flavor in this pie was wonderful, but I too, had a runny finished product.  I followed the instructions perfectly, but WILL try this recipe again and adjust the flour a bit to see if that will help.  We didn't let it go to waste, we just put it in a bowl and ate it like a pudding.  Thank you for sharing this with me."
173579,69173,2006-04-09,5,"Kittencal, These meatballs were just wonderful!  I had my family over and had italian dishes.  This was one of them.  My family said they had never had any meatballs so good.  Will be having them again soon, I""m sure.  Thanks for posting.  "
158086,69173,2007-03-04,5,I have to say these were the star dish of my Sunday dinner...I served about 22 people and everyone kept raving about the meatballs...
166642,69173,2007-04-01,5,"These are now my favorite meatballs. I've always added Parmesan or Romano cheese to my meatballs, but I love the extra pepper and oregano in these. I have usually always baked mine in the oven, but I tried just putting them in the sauce this time and I loved how they turned out. Much softer and they do absorb the sauce nicely. Thank you Kitten."
136997,69173,2007-05-05,4,"Delicious! My husband was so happy when I made spaghetti and these meatballs, as I don't make that kind of meal very often. I used ground chicken and I increased the seasonings a bit. Nice texture and I simmered them in the sauce being careful not to over stir them. :)"
53932,69173,2007-11-17,5,I used ground turkey and the meatballs were excellent!  I  baked them in a 350 oven for about 25 minutes and served with a mushroom sauce over egg noodles.
482376,69173,2007-11-19,5,"Fantastic! I made these meatballs to go with Kittencal's Spaghetti and Meatball Casserole, which is awesome.  The meatballs came out tender and had great flavor.I wasn't sure if I should have used plain bread crumbs, but I only had Italian style and it worked well. 
Thanks for a wonderful meatball recipe! :-)"
204024,69173,2007-12-02,5,This are great! 1 2x the recipe.I just cooked in the oven and will freeze 1/2 of them for an easy dinner some night. This is the only meatball that my DD thinks is good. Made for cookbook tag 2007
176615,69173,2008-06-06,5,"Wonderful! I've been meaning to make these meatballs for some time, but tonight used the recipe for burgers. Really delicious from the grill, and would be equally wonderful with spaghetti sauce. Used homemade whole wheat breadcrumbs, 1/2 c parmesan, 2 T fresh garlic, and seasoned salt as suggested by Kitten. Will make again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
197023,69173,2008-09-02,5,"Seriously, what is there for reviewer 313 to say that hasn't already been said? These meatballs were deliciously moist and flavoursome, but I'd expect nothing less from one of KITTENCAL's recipes. I made them from a 50/50 mix of beef and veal/pork, which I always find an appealing balance of flavours. Except for using less salt, and adding some marjoram to the oregano and parsley, I made them exactly to the recipe. I baked them first for about twenty minutes - in silicon mini muffin pans because there's then no time-consuming shaping involved and because the silicon pans release the meatballs with such ease. Then I dropped them into the simmering sauce mixture, which I had on a low heat and simmered for longer than the specified time. They smelt wonderful while they were cooking. For the sauce, I used MarraMamba's The Simplest Tomato Sauce Ever (Marcella Hazan) 273976 to which, on this occasion, I had added some red wine to replace most of the juice from the canned tomatoes. I used a low-fat milk. Made for Zaar Stars Tag: what else?"
37449,69173,2008-09-11,5,I made this using ground chuck. I simmered in spaghetti sauce. My husband really enjoyed with whole wheat angel hair pasta. Thanks Kit!
428885,69173,2008-11-03,5,"Kitten you are such a kewl cat! I love these meat-balls! Just outstanding, and now will consider this to be my main meatball of the season. I followed this exactly as written, and squirted a bit of ketchup (about 1 tablespoon) in the whole mix, and gently tossed together and followed the recipe from there. Outstanding! What-ta-meat-balll! Thanks so much for making my life easier, Kit!"
47892,69173,2008-12-12,4,"I baked the meatballs then served them with pasta sauce (good ol' Hunts~ ;). The mixture worked well, even after having frozen the meat a few days before baking. ~Tasty Dish~ approved! For Kittencal."
226863,69173,2009-02-01,5,"Today I made these instead of the meatballs listed in your Recipe #218911.  Very similar, but I added 1/2 lb pork to the other recipe.  I like both meatball recipes!  These are always requested by my DS for anything special...today the superbowl. Thanks for posting such great recipes!"
452355,69173,2009-02-23,5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This meatball recipe was easy and delicious---a real keeper.  I simmered in a zucchini flower and garlic pasta sauce with capers.  Yum!  I served over linguine and topped with parmesan cheese.  This tasted just as good or better when I reheated it and had it for lunch today.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks, Kittencal!"
461834,69173,2009-03-12,5,"Wonderful meatballs!!!  I made these using all ground beef.  These are very similar to the way I make meatballs but I always add chopped/minced onion, so I did opt to add them to yours.  I also used crushed saltines for the bread crumbs but otherwise followed as written.  I chose to bake them in the oven for about 35-40 minutes, as I made jumbo size meatballs.  My family, as well as my 16 yo DS's friend enjoyed these meatballs.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Stars Tag."
126440,69173,2009-03-15,5,I made this using beef and pork and we loved the recipe.  Made it to go with my Recipe #360048. I partially cooked the meat balls in the oven and then into the sauce to finish. Served it with parmesan bread and was a delicious meal.
140132,69173,2009-08-02,5,"Another excellent recipe from you Kittencal!  I made these last night and they cooked up beautifully.  Very flavorful meatballs and kept their shape in the sauce.  Thank you so much for a good meatball recipe.  We love meatballs but I was haviing trouble finding ""the one"" recipe.  Thank you for sharing this with us."
1179225,69173,2009-08-15,5,Yummmmmy! We loved these and plan on making plenty more to keep in the freezer. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
133174,69173,2012-07-09,5,These are very good.  I used ground turkey and omitted the milk.  The meatballs were formed and dropped into rapid boiling water for a few minutes to firm up.  They were carefully transferred to a baking sheet and baked for about 20 to 25 minutes.  After cooling the meatballs were frozen for later use.  This is something I will be making again.  Thank you for sharing.
400708,69173,2012-07-12,5,"I saved this recipe so long ago I'd almost forgotten about it.  Finally got around to trying it and it won't take me this long to make it again, and again.  So easy to make, and love that I can freeze them and have them ready for anytime to pull out and serve.  The taste is perfect and goes so well with spagetti but would also be great served on their own, maybe as a sub, so many options and always on the ready in the fridge.  These are going to be a regular in my fridge and always a batch on the ready."
89831,110506,2006-04-03,5,"Dotty, these muffins certainly live up to there name! I made these into 8 jumbo muffins and used 3 teaspoons vanilla, I also increased the baking soda to 1-1/2 teaspoon. These are soooooo good! thanks Dotty!...Kitten:)"
324390,110506,2007-01-15,5,I made this to use up some of the apples from my grandmother's tree and they are scrumptious! I added a tsp. of cinnamon to the batter and used liners for my muffin pan. These came out great!
158086,110506,2010-10-05,5,Wonderful muffins!  I doubled the recipe and used honeycrisp apples...
126440,110506,2012-02-19,5,"We loved these muffins.  I used four apples, grated and was out of butter.  Served with egg, sausage scramble."
222564,78194,2006-12-16,5,"YUM! The sauce made these quesadillas really delish and apart from all the other recipes. No salsa and sour cream needed with these, necessarily. I only used 2 chicken breasts and that was enough. Maybe that is the reason we found them just a little hotter than recuired, so leaving the cayenne out of the sauce might be an idea."
140132,78194,2007-10-31,5,"Five stars....again, and again and again....lol.  We absolutely loved these.  I have made these a few times and will make them many more times.  I especially loved the sauce....yummy.  I doubled the sauce recipe and we used it on other things the rest of the week. I have never had Taco Bell Quesadillas so I don't know if they are like the real thing, but as far as I'm concerned....these are the REAL DEAL....thanks, Stephanie"
126440,78194,2014-05-04,5,"Very good but didn&#039;t need the American cheese, would have been good without.  Loved the sauce."
1072593,302120,2010-10-08,0,Looks like all the good comments have already been taken. :-)
158086,302120,2011-09-28,5,"I really liked this recipe. It smelled wonderful cooking.  I did add<br/>some fresh green beans to it, but otherwised followed the recipe...<br/>A must try..."
126440,302120,2012-12-08,5,Great recipe.  I made a serving for two and it turned out great.  I did add mushrooms but otherwise as written.
222564,302120,2013-01-10,5,"The sauciest, best shepherd's pie ever! Seems a basic recipe, but it is fab!"
140132,302120,2014-04-26,5,"I made this for St. Patty&#039;s Day and we enjoyed this very much.  I usually make a corned beef, but your description had me thinking, so I went with your recipe instead.  Big hit.  My family liked it very much.  I used ground beef as I wasn&#039;t sure if they would all like the lamb, but I might be more adventurous next time and try the lamb.  Thank you for our holiday meal.  Great choice on my part, thanks to you."
95743,42169,2003-12-08,5,Superb!  Wanted to see if this recipe would make good appetizers if smaller shrimp were used.  It does!  I used one pound of 41-50 count shrimp and the other ingredients and quantities as written.  They baked in five minutes and were outstanding.
158086,42169,2004-09-08,5,"i made these for labor day weekend as we had company, and i had to give them the recipe...it was a huge hit and looked like it took me all day to make...fantastic"
41578,42169,2005-02-01,5,"Wonderful shrimp.  Most of us never had shrimp made with Parmesan before and let me tell you these were gone in minutes!  Thanks for sharing, Marie!!!
 "
88099,42169,2005-12-30,5,"I'll add my 5 stars to this one.  I did add the juice of a half of lemon to the olive oil, garlic mixture, but other than that made as directed.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks so much for a great recipe."
160974,42169,2006-11-07,5,"These were every bit as good as I had hoped!I lined the baking sheet with  Pam sprayed foil. Can't wait to make these again! Thanks so much, Marie.

Roxygirl"
140132,42169,2008-01-20,4,"very good.  Iwill continue to make shrimp this was....thank you, Stephanie"
386585,42169,2008-01-23,5,"I absolutely loved these.  It was pretty simple to make, and well worth it.  I was sick of making the standard Shrimp Scampi or Shrimp Marinara, and this definitely mixed things up a bit!"
173579,42169,2009-01-09,5,Nice tasting shrimp.  So quick and easy.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
126440,42169,2009-03-15,5,"I have made these a couple of times and they are just great.  I served them with Recipe #51504 and Recipe #50847.  Great, easy meal."
128473,42169,2017-11-30,5,"Wow, did we ever enjoy the shrimp prepared this way. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe that has made it into my Best of Cookbook for 2017. Kudos to you... The shrimp were incredible, perfectly cooked, flavorful and had a wonderful texture. Made for What's on the Menu? Tag Game."
280271,42169,2018-01-24,5,These are so yummy and crispy...I just squeezed a bit of lemon juice on them...they are a keeper...made for &quot;the best of 2017&quot; tag game...
482376,42169,2018-02-24,5,"Absolutely delicious!! I loved this style for cooking shrimp. The shrimp were crispy on the outside and very tasty! Next time, I'll skip adding salt since the Parmesan provides enough. Thank you for a great recipe! A winner for sure!"
5060,63786,2005-06-19,5,"Very tasty fajitas!! I used a chicken breast left over from last night. I used red sweet pepper, a jalepeno, red onion and mushroom. Cut everything in strips and followed your recipe except I added the cooked chicken at the end. Thanks for posting we will do again. Pamela's photo caught my eye."
140132,63786,2007-08-23,4,"We used sirloin steak and they were delicious.  I thought they were a breeze to prepare and the taste was very good.  Thank you for something a little different from our ""usual"".   Stephanie"
1072593,63786,2011-08-28,5,The family had that look like when you throw a handful of crumbs at a bunch of pigeons.  They all swoop into a pile knocking each other over to get there first and fight for the best spot.
1179225,63786,2012-02-06,4,Really good and easy to put together. Thanks for posting!
560491,63786,2013-05-22,5,"Great seasoning/marinade!  Not too spicy which is what I like.  I made these with chicken and used red and yellow peppers.  I marinated the chicken for approx. 8 hours and it gave the meat a great flavor.  Will be making these again, it was so quick and easy!  Made for Name That Ingredient Tag."
37449,9272,2002-04-17,5,"I have made alot of salsa, and this is excellent. 
I couldn't find my cumin, and didn't have fresh 
jalapenos,so I used some pickled and it still 
turned out great! Thanks."
17803,9272,2006-09-09,5,"I doubled my batch and got 15 pints.  I stayed pretty true to your recipe. I seeded my tomatoes, did not use the sugar and used red wine vinegar.  The salsa was very thick with a nice flavor and I'd say it's between medium to hot for us. Thanks for sharing your recipe.  We will be making this again. "
323186,9272,2007-03-12,0,"I havent tried this yet,  but with this many reviews,  it has Got to be a winner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   It looks great,  Ill try it very soon and let you know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
222564,9272,2007-01-22,5,"Wow, great stuff! Just like our favorite salsa from the shop, which they all of sudden don't make anymore. This recipe is a real savior for us! I did not add tomato sauce, as it was all looking good and saucy enough, without it. 
As I was making a lot smaller portion for trial, I didn't can it, just refridgerated after 10 mins of cooking. I also used just normal salt, half of amount of the canning salt. It was so good we chomped it off in no time at all, with corn chips."
88099,9272,2007-08-12,5,"Not that you need another review but had to add my 5 starts to this.  I needed some salsa for dinner tonight and didn't have any, so I decided to try this with canned diced tomatoes and a can of rotel, blended in the blender.  I halved the recipe for the two of us and it turned out great.  I simmered this on the stove for about an hour and a half.  I didn't have tomato sauce or tomato paste so used an extra can of tomatoes blended in the blender.  Worked out great.  The spice combination was just right.  thanks"
176615,9272,2008-07-06,5,"Had a bunch of fresh tomatoes to use, and am so happy I found this recipe. Loved it! Rather than process the jars, I cooked a little longer, jarred, and stored in the fridge. Will make a batch with cilantro added, too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
173579,9272,2008-08-23,5,This is a great salsa!  Thanks for posting.
126440,9272,2009-12-17,4,I made two pints of this for my first ever salsa.  I canned them this summer and this is the first time using the salsa.  A bit too sweet for me but DH said it was great.  Will try again next summer with more home grown tomatoes.
1072593,9272,2012-06-25,5,"10 Stars!  With 411 winning reviews, we need to start up a Camp Fooddotcom...and have winners and stuff like that.  [To the batch, I added the juice of 1 lime after turning off the fire and before processing.]"
1179225,9272,2013-08-13,5,"Excellent! Doubled the recipe, left the skins on, left out the sugar, halved the cumin, added 2 teaspoons of chili powder, 2 tablespoons of cayenne, 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro. So easy and looks great in the jars. Thanks for sharing this terrific keeper, recipe!"
140132,9272,2013-09-18,5,"This was delicious salsa.  I used the food processor to save time and so the veggies were all evenly cut.  The addition of the tomato sauce and paste made this the best.  We loved it.  I put mine up in pint jars and I got 8 pints.  Thank you for sharing, I&#039;m off to make another batch now!"
160974,87085,2004-12-17,5,"I made this awhile ago and forgot to post my review! First of all, the photo of the dish had me scrambling to get my ingredients together. Secondly, I love recipes that are based on cafeteria food. I think because I love the cozy feeling associated with ""diner"" food. This recipe didn't disappoint me. Besides being easy to assemble, it cut great, family enjoyed it, and I will be making it again, today!

173579,87085,2005-07-20,5,This was the best baked spaghetti recipe that I have ever tried.  It was awesome.  My whole family even loved it also.  That's unusual for that to happen.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  I will be making it many more times.
176615,87085,2005-08-19,5,"Great family-friendly meal! I made this for ""Freeze-It Tag,"" so froze the unbaked casserole, defrosted, then baked covered at 350 till hot throughout. Uncovered and finished baking at 425. Everyone ate and enjoyed it, so I plan on keeping a few pans in my freezer for busy weeknight meals. Thanks, Kim!"
95743,87085,2006-01-28,5,"Don't think there's much I can add to the previous 46 reviews except my 50-something year old ""kid"" loved this."
47892,87085,2006-09-10,5,I was magically transported back in time with this recipe! It smells exactly as our school cafeteria's baked spaghetti. Pure comfort food eaten with a big cheesy grin! Only thing differently I did was replaced green bell pepper with red bell pepper and broke the uncooked spaghettis strands up into fourths. Can't wait for cold weather again to prepare this! It's been almost a year since I tried this recipe and forgot to review it. Thanks for posting and for the stroll down Memory Lane.  cg;)
140132,87085,2007-08-23,5,"Mmmmmmm, very good.  We really enjoyed this dish.  The flavors worked well together and who doesn't love pasta???   I have made this twice now and we loved it both times.....I will be making this often.  Thank you.......STephanie"
158086,87085,2008-02-18,5,Great recipe...I doubled and added some fiesta corn to it....we really liked it.
126440,87085,2013-01-10,5,Excellent recipe!  Loved how quick and easy it was.  Made half a recipe and still have enough for another night.  Used Anaheim pepper for the green.
4470,15865,2009-04-19,5,"The whole recipe is special but the special sauce is outstanding! I used this recipe for appetizers made the lettuce rolls small and they were devoured. I got every thing ready in the am and just reheated the filling before serving Excellent 5 star recipe
Added comments: I can't say enough about this ""special sauce"" just the right amount of hotness (I used 2 tsp chili/garlic)and the flavor is wonderful Lettuce Wraps were part of a Christmas Eve Buffet  MMMMMMMMgood

Made again 19 April 09  Used left over forzen turkey and previous remarks say it all  Thanks again for a super recipe"
140132,15865,2009-08-07,3,"We tried this and it was OK.  I think we were expecting a bit more spice in this but it was just ok for us....sorry.  I loved the whole concept of the lettuce wraps but we just didn't enjoy it as much as we hoped too.  Thank you for sharingthis  with us, it was definately something we have never had before."
126440,15865,2012-03-07,5,I only used 1 chicken breast for the two of us and fresh water chestnuts.  Wow really good.  Loved the sauce and will make again soon to use up my Butter lettuce from BB.  Served with a veggie stir fry and soup.
53932,116849,2005-04-23,5,"This is really good!  As the flavors do get stronger over time, you might want to make half a batch for a small family.  However, it tastes so good that it probably won't sit around long.  Thanks for sharing!"
136997,116849,2005-08-01,5,WOW! This was awesome! I did cut back on the garlic as my cloves were very big. This is sooo much better than  bottled. :) 
176615,116849,2005-11-21,5,"Excellent! I love Caesar dressing but will no longer make the traditional recipe with raw egg, so this recipe is a real find. Easy to put together and has just the right balance of flavors in a creamy and delicious dressing. I tossed with romaine, fresh parmesan and homemade garlic croutons for a real treat. Like all dressings, this should be made in advance so the flavors have a chance to meld. Thanks, Kittencal, for a great recipe!"
8688,116849,2006-07-26,5,"Kittencal, I don't know how you do it!  This is one sensational Caesar Salad dressing!!  This recipe is so simple to put together, with ingredients that are normally in my cabinet! So why have I been buying mediocre Caesar salad dressing from the grocery store, when I can make a  Superior Caesar Salad Dressing right in my own kitchen? When Kittencal makes a statement that a recipe is ""Delicious"" you  better pay attention, or you will miss out on something quite extraordinary!  Thanks again and again, Kittencal, for sharing all your fabulous recipes!!"
47892,116849,2007-03-22,5,"As good if not better than any Caesar salad I've tasted in restaurants. Used fresh romaine from a local farm and my own homemade croutons. (I could make a meal off the salad dressing all by itself.) I omitted using salt in the dressing for the Worcestershire sauce took care of that aspect. The dressing was allowed to refrigerate a good 3 hours which only enhanced its flavor. For the anchovy fillets, convenient anchovy paste in the tube was used; Grey Poupon for the Dijon. Served alongside of Recipe #72525. Best part? No raw egg. :)"
452940,116849,2007-12-13,5,"ooh this was so good! I left out the anchovies for personal preference, but other than that made exactly to specs. I think it will be even better tomorrow when the flavors will have blended together. I served it about an hour after making it. Thanks Kitten! -Bird-"
173579,116849,2008-01-03,5,This was a very tasty caesar salad.  Really quick to make.  Thanks for posting.
160974,116849,2008-01-07,5,"Hi Kitten! We sure enjoyed your easy Caesar dressing in you tortellini Caesar salad. I used ff half and half. Thanks so much.

Roxygirl"
95743,116849,2008-05-13,5,I made recipe #166669 for Mother's Day and used the dressing from this recipe.  It was marvelous and raved about by my entire family of in-laws.  the cherry on top was recipe #125034.  Make this.  You'll love it.
461834,116849,2008-09-20,5,"Wonderful Caesar Salad!!!  I was worried about the dijon mustard being over powering, as it isn't one of my favorites, but it was just right.  I even got my picky 20 yo DD to try and she liked it also.  I used anchovy paste, otherwise followed as written.  Thanks Kittencal for another great recipe.  Made for zaar star tag."
140132,116849,2009-03-02,5,"I love caesar salads and have always shyed away from making them at home.  No more, this is so easy and tastes great.  Its fast, easy and tastes just like the restaraunts.  I used anchovy paste instead of the fillets, other then that I followed to a T.  Thank you for posting."
1072593,116849,2009-05-13,5,"Hail Caesar, for he's a man that knows his salad dressings!  Made for Healthy Choices ABC Tag '09."
386585,116849,2010-07-19,5,"This truly lived up to all expectations!  I made this exactly as posted (except I used buttermilk instead of half-and-half or milk) but tripling the ingredients for the dressing.  I ended up with more than enough dressing to use on quadrupled salad ingredients, with plenty left over.  I added some halved grape tomatoes to the salad (for color) and brought this to my annual church picnic.  It was a real hit!  I will definitely make a batch of the dressing again to have on hand!  Also, instead of using grated parmesan on the salad, I used some nice shredded parmesan.  Thanks for another perfect recipe, Carol!"
593927,116849,2010-08-21,5,"I made a version of the dressing and it was really good. I left out the anchovies and used whole milk and heavy cream! I had to use a plain mustard but can tell it would be good with such as called for. Instead of  Worcestershire sauce I just added sea salt as I didn't have any. I would make this again the same way, but would like to try with freshly grated parmesan cheese which I did not have this time."
482376,116849,2011-05-03,5,WOW. This is going straight into my best of the best file. I loved the dressing!!! It was perfect with the romaine and croutons. I did use anchovy paste instead of anchovy filets. I ended up using about 1 t. of the paste. I didn't think the dressing needed any more salt. It was perfect. Thank you!
158086,73825,2007-11-26,5,Very good carrot cake we really enjoyed it.
173579,73825,2008-10-13,5,Nice tasting cake.  It was very simple to put together.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
140132,73825,2009-03-06,5,"5 +++++ stars!  This is absolutely fabulous!  I printed this recipe out a couple of years ago and never got around to making it.  OMG, I was such a fool.  This is by far the best cake I have ever made.  It is rich and so moist and I love the addition of pineapple and coconut.  My family went nuts over this cake, I'm so glad I finally got around to trying it, cuz it will definately be repeated.....over and over and over....lol.  Thank you so much for posting."
452940,73825,2009-05-06,5,"Not only is this cake moist and delicious, it's super easy to make too! I used just 1 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 cup each of coconut and pecans (in lieu of the walnuts). I chose to incorporate the sugar into the dry mix before making the well for the eggs, oil, and vanilla and it worked fine. For the icing, I reduced the butter to half a stick and used just 2/3 cup of icing sugar. The entire thing was perfect and not overly sweet. Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)"
1179225,73825,2009-09-14,5,Loved this cake! We thought it was better the next day. Can't really add anything that hasn't already been said. Thank you for this great and easy recipe.
140132,114392,2009-06-10,5,OMG..... this sauce is awesome!  I made this for homemade pizza tonight and we LOVED it.  I agree and think its a good idea to triple and freeze this.  I made as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.
452355,114392,2009-11-09,5,"This is a simple to make, fantastic tasting pizza sauce.  We used it for grilled pizzas with homemade crust, Recipe #236785 236785, which went together really well.  I made no modifications to the ingredients.  I don't think I have to look any further for a perfect pizza sauce---this is the one I will be using in the future.  Thanks, SAMS-Club!"
126440,114392,2009-11-21,5,Wonderful.  I used this with thin crusted pizza and pepperoni.  I had the last piece for lunch.  Loved it.
1179225,114392,2011-02-14,5,Perfect! Wouldn't change a thing. The fennel is the key. This sauce has just the right amount of zing.Thanks so much for posting.
176615,114392,2012-11-11,5,"Very good, thick pizza sauce. I minced the celery and onion to avoid chunks. Love the fennel. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
400708,349246,2012-06-16,4,"4 Stars for taste when right out of the oven, wonderful chocolaty richness, but after setting for awhile got so hard we couldn't eat it and that was a real shame as we loved it.  I'll make it again but will make sure we eat it straight out of the micro.  A very nice, fast treat when you are craving just a single serving (don't want to much sitting around)"
101823,101104,2003-11-28,5,"This is a staple pumpkin pie recipe.  Everyone loves it.  I have added a little more spices, or a little dark rum, but it is wonderful just the way it is.  I have tried other pumpkin pie recipes, but this is the one everyone wants."
53932,101104,2005-09-29,5,This is on our family's table every Thanksgiving as well and it always tastes great. I don't mess with a classic--it's perfect as is.
8688,101104,2006-09-30,5,This is my standard recipe for pumpkin pie. I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I make my own crust.  It's perfect! ; )
104295,101104,2006-11-24,5,This is the pie recipe I always use.  Classic pumpkin pie.  A nice addition to my Thanksgiving table this year!
461834,101104,2007-11-24,5,"Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  It turned out wonderfully!!  I used a frozen pie crust, and I didn't prebake, that came in a metal pan.  The crust was done on the bottom and the edges didn't even burn.  Great recipe!!"
204024,101104,2008-11-27,5,"This is THE standard, classic American pumpkin pie as I remember it from rural childhood. We used brown sugar instead of white, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Made mostly by DD15 and served after Thanksgiving dinner 2008."
140132,101104,2009-11-09,5,"Absolutely delicious pumpkin pie!  I made this for my family yesterday and we loved it!  DH went for seconds, which is a feat in itself....lol.  I plan on making this for our holidays every year.  Thank you for sharing this with us."
1179225,101104,2011-11-25,5,Pumpkin pie doesn't get better than this!
4470,21761,2002-04-05,5,"The recipe is perfect the way it is but I always have to play around a bit Sooooo I cut out the butter, sprayed the inside of a plastic bag  with lite olive oil, added powdered garlic (not often I use it vs real garlic) added the parmesan and sprouts to the bag shook the bag to coat the sproats and then baked them on a baking stone in a 375F oven for 30 minutes. The result was very nice and a bit lower cal.  I still prefer your recipe as is!   I am actually liking Sproats!"
95743,21761,2003-10-31,4,"Very, very good.  Didn't realize the sprouts would soak up all the oil and butter.  I would definitely cut way back next time."
101823,21761,2004-03-09,4,"Brussel sprouts are one of my husband's favorite vegetables.  These were awesome.  In my rush to get dinner on the table, I forgot to add the grated parmesan cheese, but still found the flavor to be great.  Loved the browned bits!"
37449,21761,2005-01-09,5,"Well, this was just delicious! My husband wants his brussel sprouts this way from now on. Thanks Tracy for a lovely way to fix sprouts! :)"
280271,21761,2006-07-09,5,Tracy K heres another 5 star for you!! Both DH and I really like brussels sprouts and this one is execptional. You can really taste the sprouts. They are not over powered by the other ingredients. They just enhance the flavor. This is going in my 5 star cookbook. Thanks for posting!
158086,21761,2007-09-18,5,"These are out of this world, I served these to dinner guests and we were wishing I had made up a bigger batch....we ate them all up.  Yummy"
199848,21761,2007-12-02,5,"If you love Brussels sprouts like I do, this is like eating candy!  The sprouts get carmelized and get a rich kind of roasted flavor.  My sproyts were very tiny, so they cooked faster and I used more than 15.  The parmesan cheese is delightful bonus, but they are just as great without the cheese.  Thanx for sharing.  I'll make my sprouts like this often."
53932,21761,2008-01-13,5,These were just excellent.  Loved the buttery garlic flavor and the ease of preparation.
369715,21761,2008-01-13,4,These were good and easy to make. I used frozen brussel sprouts and didn't cut them in half. Followed the rest of the recipe as written adding the optional parmesan cheese.
140132,21761,2008-06-26,5,"Very good.  I made this the other night for a veggie and my family loved them.  I really liked the addition  of parmesan cheese, delicious.  Thank you for posting."
424680,21761,2008-07-01,5,"What a great, easy way to put together a tasty veggie dish! And it certainly dresses up the ol' Brussels sprouts! Thanks for sharing this keeper of a recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed in the I Recommend cooking game]"
296809,21761,2009-02-19,5,"Made for the *Best of 2008* cookbook tag game, we are garlic & sprout lovers so this recipe is great for us. Such an easy-fix & so good, even using the frozen sprouts I had to use. I used the opt Parm cheese + a liberal amt of lemon pepper & served them w/roasted chicken & potatoes. We loved them! Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)"
80353,21761,2009-09-23,5,I cannot believe I haven't rated this recipe as I've been making it for years.  This is my 'go-to' recipe for Brussels Sprouts.  The sprouts are wonderful this way and couldn't be easier to make.
486725,21761,2010-01-04,5,Delicious. Caramelized is the way to go. I used only 1/2 tablespoon each of the fats and it was more than enough.
222564,21761,2013-01-01,5,Love them!
126440,133751,2010-01-14,5,Great Teriyaki.  Made it to use in Recipe #247601.  I did use fresh garlic and ginger but made as written otherwise.
1072593,133751,2010-02-24,5,Buddha approves.
1179225,133751,2010-05-15,5,This turned out perfect! I'll never buy teriyaki sauce from the store again. What a money saver. Thanks so much for posting!
56003,133751,2010-08-14,4,"Very good!  Made this to go with Recipe #388539.  I don't usually have teriyaki sauce on hand, so this was a good go-to recipe.  Thnx for posting, JuniperNW."
158086,103215,2007-05-16,5,This is the first time I ever tried to make breaded chicken like this.  I tripled the sauce because of the other reviews...It was great....we loved it.
222564,103215,2010-01-21,5,"Sweet and orangey, very very good and different! I did double the sauce, but will triple it next time. Water could be subbed with orange juice, like suggested before."
140132,103215,2010-05-11,5,"I made this last night and we loved it.  The orange flavor really stands out wonderfully.  I didn't use the slurry in this and we didn't feel like we needed it.  I will repeat this recipe often, its so easy and tastes great!!!  Thank you so much for posting this fantastic recipe."
226863,103215,2011-04-23,4,"I have mixed feelings about this recipe....the instructions are horrible for the first part......I made as posted and the flour/egg mix just clumped up.  Made lumpy bumps that had to be spread over the chicken.  The chicken should be dipped in the egg mixture, then tossed in the cornstarch mix.  It would save a lot of work. I loved the sauce, and agree with other posters that it should be doubled....it is sooo good!  For a beginner cook, I'm afraid this would be so confusing that they would give up, which isn't good.  This recipe is good and deserves a chance, but the instructions are so confusing that many will not make this recipe.  I can't compare this to Panda Express, as I've never had it.  But the sauce is delicious if you  can figure out how to make the first part of the recipe!!  I enjoyed this, but the instructions just aren't clear enough.I would dip in the egg first and then the cornstarch/flour mix.  Really enjoyed the finished product!  Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe."
560491,103215,2011-07-27,5,"Very good and close to Panda Express!  I should have made this years ago living in WI where there weren't any close!  I cut back on the red pepper flakes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Made for I Recommend Tag."
89831,79563,2005-08-16,5,"FANTASTIC!!!! I had a huge ham bone sitting in my freezer, and I wanted to make your recipe, I was just waiting for a cooler day, and today was it! I used 5 cups of chicken broth and 5 cups water in place of all 12 cups water, and only used 1 beef cube... wonderful smokey taste that thickened up to just the right consistancy. I let it simmer slowley for about 2 hours, we really enjoyed this with homemade crusty buns...Uncle Bill has done it again! thanks for another winner!...Kitten:)"
53932,79563,2005-10-07,5,"What a great soup!  I used only 8 cups of water and had a nice, thick soup.  As I was somewhat pressed for time, I simmered the peas for 20 minutes (rather than letting them sit for an hour in boiling water).  Added 2 small bay leaves, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!"
107135,79563,2006-04-05,5," this is how i make it  too its really good .dee
"
169969,79563,2009-01-19,5,Excellent Split Pea Soup. I will make this recipe EVERY time I have leftover ham-bone! Thank you Uncle Bill!
17803,79563,2010-11-29,5,"William, you did it again, another wonderful soup using a leftover ham bone for our holiday dinner!!  This was a very easy recipe to make but still packed in a lot of flavor.  I made this in a crock pot on high heat and added the peas the last hour.   You'll like this William, Sarah, our picky daughter, even liked this.  Telling me this recipe was better then any of my own throw together pea soup recipes.  I was not offended at all.  I don't remember if she tried your Indian Split Pea Soup, in 2006 she still might have been to picky.  Thanks for another wonderful recipe."
653438,79563,2011-01-02,5,I made this last week and forgot to review this.  WONDERFUL...if I could give more than 5 stars I would.  Followed the directions only adding 3 minced garlic cloves and 2 diced potatoes....heaven.  Definately going into my Favorites of 2010.  Thank you Uncle Bill for submitting such a delicious recipe.
126440,79563,2011-02-01,5,DH said wonderful soup.  I made this for him using leftover ham bone.  Easy to do but took longer than stated.  Left out the salt and was still great.
140132,79563,2012-10-29,5,"Mmmmmmm....comforting soup for the cold weather.  I made this using a ham hock and it turned out fantastic.  The flavor was spot on to what I remember my mom making.  I pureed half the soup and left the other half ""chunky"" and it was perfect for us.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us, I'm always wanting some different soups for the winter time and I'm glad we chose yours."
5060,20616,2002-03-18,5,"Wonderfull Soda Bread!!  Very light and lots of raisins and caraway. Didn't change a thing and it is the best I've made in years!!  A real keeper, thanks for sharing 1Steve, we will make it again and again."
324390,20616,2007-03-18,5,This was so much moister than my previous recipe. We'll be using this one for now on! I used 1 1/2 T of caraway seeds and otherwise followed the recipe. Perfect!
176615,20616,2008-03-29,5,Excellent! Made for St. Patty's Day. Lighter and softer than other soda breads I've tried. Used a cast iron skillet. Wouldn't even think of omitting the caraway seeds! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
482376,20616,2010-04-02,5,Adding yet another 5 star rating to this recipe. It was the best Irish soda bread I have ever made/had. The flavor and texture is perfect. Thank you so much!
8688,20616,2011-03-12,5,"This is a fabulous recipe!  Simple to throw together for the newest of chefs. Most ingredients readily on hand.  The 1/2 cup of sugar and dash of raisins lends a kiss of sweetness and the best of compliments to your corned beef supper.  I served with corned beef, carrots and steamed cabbage. Thanks so much for sharing this, 1Steve!"
1179225,20616,2014-06-08,5,"Really quick and simple recipe to mix together and the loaf looked beautiful, a real show piece. The only change I would make next time would be to use only 1 T. of caraway seeds, just personal preference. This bread is wonderful toasted. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
160974,66596,2004-10-25,5,This was exactly what it claimed to be: the ultimate Greek salad! There is so much flavor in the salad dressing with the perfect spice blend. I brought it to a party and it disappeared fast.
41578,66596,2004-05-19,5,"This Greek Salad is the best!  The combination and amounts of the ingredients in the dressing is right on the mark.  It just doesn't get any better than this...wonderful flavor and so easy to prepare.  Thanks so much, KittenCal !
"
53932,66596,2005-07-28,5,Great salad!  I added 1/2 tsp black pepper to the dressing and used the full amount of salt. Also put some pepperocini on the salad. Thank you!
133174,66596,2004-09-19,5,I can sum up this review in one word Awesome!  I followed the directions for the dressing to the letter and blended it in my blender.  Probably used a little less feta cheese than called for and of course used Greek olives.  I used a seedless cucumber.  Everyone was wowed.  Thankx!
107135,66596,2005-08-10,5,i did like it lol dee
136997,66596,2006-05-04,5,"Another winner for Kittencal! There are only 2 of us who like greek salad, so I had to adjust the amounts to 2 servings. I didn't have any trouble at all. Added the sugar and had to leave out the olives, since I didn't have any on hand. Deliciously fresh tasting. :)"
88099,66596,2006-06-10,5,Excellent Greek salad.  I made just as directed.  Loved the dressing in this.  Thanks Kitz.
158086,66596,2007-02-01,5,"Boy was this salad a hit at my sunday dinner for my family and friends....I did add some diced beets, it was wonderful...will make over and over I bet..."
37449,66596,2007-05-23,5,Yummy! I had this for dinner tonight with meatless riblets and Brussel sprouts. I mixed in spinach and cilantro with the romaine and used jumbo black olives. Loved it! Thank you Kitten!
8688,66596,2007-08-22,5,"Wonderful salad and dressing, Kittencal!  I made as directed for the perfect accompaniment for our steak dinner and served with recipe #185498.  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipes with us : )"
140132,66596,2008-01-19,5,"I printed this recipe a long time ago, not sure if we would like such bold flavors.  Well, I made this last night and wow was it sensational.  Hubby and I couldn't get enough of it.  DH is a thousand island man only, so I wasn't sure how he would feel about this salad but he loved it.  Even took the left overs with him for lunch today.  The feta cheese in this is great, I love the sharp taste with the dressing and the rest of the ingredients.  I only wish I wouldn't have waited so long to try.  Thank you soooo much for posting, we will be making this often...Stephanie"
204024,66596,2008-05-13,5,This is a very good salad.  It was our first try of a greek salad.  We made it for Mother's Day Dinner with my DH's side of the family. We followed all ingredients per recipe except fo rthe kalamata olives.  We used burgundy olives from a can.  They fit in very well in the salad.  Made for Salad and Berry Challenge May 2008
126440,66596,2009-06-29,5,This salad is heavenly.  Will have to make this at least once a week for DH.  He loved it.  Served it with Recipe #256734 and Recipe #87782.  Wonderful meal.
482376,66596,2010-09-08,5,"Fabulous Greek salad. The dressing was out-of-this-world good. My daughter never puts dressing on her salads, but LOVED this one. Everything was super easy to put together and was delicious to eat. The only thing I left out was the green pepper. Thanks for a wonderful Greek salad recipe! :)"
171790,66596,2011-02-11,5,I made this salad for tonight's dinner. I cut the amount of dressing in half but otherwise made it as directed. For the salad I used a blend of lettuce which had mainly romaine in it. Wonderful! Made for Best of 2010 Tag Game Event.
593927,66596,2013-08-28,5,"Perfect Greek salad but it was too much dressing for the amount of ingredients and there was a pool of dressing in the bottom of the serving dish and I did follow the directions to add before serving. I have now made this a number of times, once even adding gluten free pasta to make it more of a meal! I used a good flavour organic olive oil, fresh organic lemon, organic mountain oregano from Greece, organic fresh garlic clove, organic apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar for religious reasons, sea salt, to taste, a little more organic cane sugar because if my change of vinegar, romaine lettuce hearts, I left out the onion, no bell pepper, plus the rest of the ingredients. I will make this dressing and salad or modified as I try to avoid cheese again!"
89831,102274,2005-11-01,5,"We loved this soup! I increased the chili powder and added in 2 jalapenos for extra spice, just so good! Thanks Little Bee for this great recipe!...Kittencal:)"
160974,102274,2006-02-22,5,"This was first rate soup. I've had Panera's twice recently and this is much better. I love the way the apple cider combines with the cumin and chile powder, resulting in a smoky flavor. I did not have liquid smoke but did add 2 pieces of cooked (microwave bacon)in. I couldn't tell if it helped or not! My whole family cleaned their bowls! I served with my Whole Wheat Rolls with Walnuts and Currants and Ladypit's Sweet and Sour Broccoli.

8688,102274,2006-10-12,5,"Oh Little Bee!  This is a wonderful recipe!  Dan told me to give you 15 stars for this one : )  Simple to make for a fantastic soup filled with lots of  flavor!  Thanks so much, Little Bee!"
88099,102274,2006-11-12,3,"Boy I hate to be the odd duck here, but this just didn't go over at all with my family.  I particularly didn't like the twang the apple cider vinegar gave it.  The spice combination was very nice though.  I had to cook the veggie mixture a lot longer than stated and the beans got kinda mushy.  "
593927,102274,2009-04-20,4,"Didn't use chili, cayenne or liquid smoke. Was real good."
126440,102274,2009-10-03,5,Great soup  I made half a recipe and it was great.  I had to use different ingredients but still turned out great.  Very versatile recipe.
1179225,102274,2009-11-08,5,"Excellent, and even better the next day."
179133,102274,2009-11-30,4,"This was good but not my favorite black bean soup recipe. I've concluded that I like a tomato element included, which this was missing. I shredded instead of dicing the carrot and left out the celery. I also used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian (or vegan actually). I sauteed the veg and then tossed everything in my crockpot on high for 1 hour, then down to low for 2 hours. Thanks for posting!"
199848,102274,2011-11-05,5,"Yummy!  I made this as written, but only pureed about 2/3 of the beans.  This has great flavor.  Don't skip the cider vinegar or the hickory smoke flavor.  They are key ingredients.  Thanx for sharing !"
452355,102274,2013-01-03,5,"This is a great soup!  It is very thick and hearty, tasty, and was not difficult to make. I made on the stovetop in my Dutch oven.  I only had 3 cans of black beans so for the fourth can I used Pinto beans, which seemed to work out fine.  I used a vegetarian-friendly substitute called ""No Chicken Broth"" for the chicken broth, and I ran out of regular chile powder before I had 2 tsp, so I subbed some ancho chile powder to make up the difference.  These modifications worked out fine.  I enjoyed topped with green onion and Monterey Jack cheese as suggested.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks!"
560491,102274,2013-06-20,5,"This is a great soup!  I have never had black bean soup so this is a great first try!  I made 1/2 the recipe since it was just me eating it (still have lots of leftovers), I used a red pepper instead of green and left out the cayenne.  Was very filling and not too spicy for me.  I topped it with cheddar cheese and green onions; will be making this in the winter time often.  Made for Name that Ingredient Tag."
158086,53878,2004-10-11,5,This will be a staple at all of our gatherings from now on..very easy and tasty...
101823,53878,2005-07-30,5,"I chopped my pepperoni in my mini food processor and then added the cream cheese.  This made prep so easy.  Everyone loved these.  I offered them on a simple appetizer buffet and pepperoni is a favorite with kids and adults, alike.  Adding cream cheese and buttery pastry to the pepperoni makes these tops.  Thanks for a recipe that everyone enjoys."
140132,53878,2007-12-31,5,yum yum   very good
8688,77585,2006-01-12,5,"Excellent recipe, Suzy! It's so nice because I generally have all these ingredients in my pantry and ready to go!  Easy to follow directions for a delicious, hot and satisfying supper!  Thanks for sharing, Suzy!"
56003,77585,2008-03-30,4,Very good flavor.  Would have again.  Just all around good eating.
653438,77585,2009-12-03,5,"I made this for lunch the other day for DH and I.  I followed the directions to a a ""t"" only cut the recipe in half.  Delicious!  This will be a regular in our house.  Thank you for a wonderful soup."
140132,77585,2009-12-29,5,Very hearty soup.  I have not tried OG's but this is wonderful.  Thank you for posting.
158086,77585,2010-04-07,5,What an easy delish soup this is!  It makes a nice big batch with very little effort...the only thing I changed was I cooked the pasta separate before I added it....
126440,77585,2010-11-15,5,"I made half a recipe as written minus the zucchini. Wonderful soup for a cold, snowy day we are having.  Served with Recipe #13584 toasted in the oven."
386585,77585,2012-01-18,5,"Delicious!  I made as exactly as posted and was rewarded with a flavorful and hearty soup.  I've never had this at Olive Garden, so I don't know how it compares, but it's wonderful in its own right.  Thanks for sharing!"
1179225,77585,2016-01-31,0,"Mmmmm....total keeper recipe! Just the right amount of seasoning and broth. Loved it! As usual I make some adjustments based on what I have on hand and our preferences my changes were to halve the amount of beans, skip the pasta and substitute finely chopped cabbage in place of the spinach. Delicious and even better the next day. Thanks so much for posting this recipe."
1072593,77585,2017-12-01,5,Good stuff! Basically brought back someone sick back from the dead.
88099,99709,2004-10-10,3,"Made this last night with orange roughy.  We like spicy food, but these spices were very strong and over powered the taste of the fish.  "
67656,99709,2005-01-05,5,"I loved the spice combination here, lots of flavor but not spicy in the peppery sense of the word. Even a chili-head like me needs a break sometime. Since I've cut bread from my diet, I used cornmeal in place of breadcrumbs. It worked well but you have to like cornmeal. Thanks ladypit. "
133174,99709,2005-11-14,5,"The fish had a nice crispy crust without added fat.  I mixed up the spice mix and used cornflake crumbs instead of the breadcrumbs, omitted the green onions and after washing and drying the fillets, misted them lightly with olive oil prior to pressing into the crumb mixture.  The fish held the crumb mixture nicely and after DH's first bite he proclaimed it delicious.  Lemon wedges were served on the side."
169969,99709,2005-11-16,5,"I loved the crispy crust on the tilapia! The flavors were so good, and the meal was so low in calories and fat! This is a winner in our house! "
173579,99709,2006-05-01,5,I used this recipe on some snapper that we caught in Florida.  It was fantastic!  My family thought it was the best they had ever had.  Very yummy.  Thanks for posting.
107583,99709,2007-01-06,5,"Very tasty!  I cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  Tilapia is our whitefish of choice, and this one will be made often!  Thanks for posting!"
5060,99709,2007-01-20,5,"Delicious fish, I used basa, we loved the spices! I will be making this again, thanks for sharing this easy, good for us recipe, a real bonus that it is low fat and low carb!"
4470,99709,2007-05-28,5,"Very easy tasty recipe - I used Panko crumbs and Basa fish, None of the herbs/spices overpower each other but they all come together to give a subtle flavor to the fish. I served the fish with Lemon Asparagus, new carrots & sweet potatoe oven fries - Wonderful dinner Thanks ladypit for a lovely dinner"
226863,99709,2007-10-18,5,"Excellent recipe!  I wanted more than one serving!  Next time I will reduce the amount of salt by half...maybe my breadcrumbs were too salty, but it was a little salty for me.  I used Morton Lite Salt, and it was still too salty for me.  The green onions in the breadcrumb mixture is wonderful. All the other spices seemed perfect.  I am on a diet, but this would be wonderful dipped into tartar sauce or with a ranch/dijon dip. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
280271,99709,2007-12-16,5,"DH and I have been trying to eat cleaner. (less fat and sugar). This hit the spot. I really was a bit worried about all the spices, but it is ""Baked Tilapia with LOTS of Spice"".
We were pleasantly surprise that the spices didn't take away from the flavor of the fish. I did serve it with a little (mayo, ketsup and a touch of horseradish mixture on the side) This is a keeper. Thanks, ladypit for posting this deliicous dish."
386585,99709,2010-02-09,4,"This was quite tasty; however, I had a hard time getting the seasoning to adhere and had to coat the fish in some beaten egg first, otherwise it would have been too dry.  The seasonings were quite good."
140132,99709,2010-10-23,5,"I made these last night for supper and we loved them.  They have the perfect amount of spices and they baked up so beautifully.  My kids usually cover their fish in tartar sauce, but the sauce hardly got touch last night.  So good, I want to thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe with us.  I will most definatly use this recipe again, it was so good."
126440,99709,2012-07-31,5,Cut the recipe down for three and used 1/2 t. salt.  Cooked in a skillet rather than the oven so was very quick.  Served in thin buns for a sandwich.  Very good.
107135,135350,2005-08-30,5,this is how my family makes it when not out of a little blue box thanks for posting it   if you want the best tasting mac and cheese guys this is how to make it
166642,135350,2006-11-21,5,"This really is your ""classic"" baked macaroni and cheese. It is so creamy and so rich with the addition of the cream. I doubled the recipe and it came out perfect. My kids loved it, too!"
1072593,135350,2009-03-10,5,"At 135 votes and counting, how can you go wrong?  This is very different from my usual egg custard-based mac and cheese.  I found it to be extremely smooth and cheesy and it got raves from my peanut gallery."
226863,135350,2009-04-03,5,"This was very good.  I usually am not a big fan of baked macaroni and cheese, especially when I can get better results on the stovetop in less time.  But this recipe was yummy.  I didn't add the breadcrumbs at the kids request.  Next time I don't think I will cook the flour/cream mix as long.  I also added extra cheese.  DS really liked it.  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag for ""F""."
140132,135350,2009-07-11,5,"Very very creamy and cheesy.  This not only tastes great but its a good workout.  My stirring arm got a workout tonight!!!  So worth very turn of the spoon.  This mac and cheese is so creamy and cheesy, perfect to go with my ribs tonight.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us."
173579,135350,2009-09-09,5,This was very good mac and cheese.  Nice creamy texture.  Will make again.  Thanks for posting.
653438,135350,2009-10-28,5,"Fixed this the other night when we went up to the cabin to close it up....I cut the recipe in half, added about another 1/4 cup of cream and added some garlic (we love garlic).  This was a delicious and creamy dish and one I definately will make again.  Served with a green salad.   Made for Alphabet Chef Tag 2009."
400708,135350,2013-07-27,5,"Made this last night and the whole family loved it - including a very picky eater nephew who declared it &quot;the best&quot; it was so easy that even that 6 year old nephew made most of it with only a little supervision.  I made as directed with only one small change - adding an extra 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese as that finished off what I had on hand.  It made a lot and that&#039;s good as we&#039;ll be having the left overs today.  Had the wonderful, creamy, cheesy goodness we love, and looked pretty too - who could ask for more."
5060,31516,2002-07-15,5,"This was very good, I used medium salsa and I replaced the cream of chicken soup with low sodium, low fat chicken broth. I will certainly make it again, it was enjoyed by all! Thanks for sharing."
140132,31516,2009-03-24,4,"I made this without the black beans and we loved this.  It was simple to throw together and baked up nice and tasty.  I served this with tortilla chips, guacamole and sour cream.  Delicious meal, thank you for posting."
158086,31516,2011-04-21,5,This was a fast easy weeknight recipe..I used chicken tenders and cooked it for one hour...turned out perfect..I too added a can of green chopped chilies...
176615,31516,2011-05-08,5,"Yummy and super easy for a busy weeknight. Instead of canned soup, I used Recipe #360192. Baked for 1 hour. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
169969,105670,2006-09-23,5,These are AWESOME!!! I followed the tips left by Pot Scrubber and they came out fantastic. DH2B asked me to make them again tonight! I love poppers but the whole deep frying ordeal is such a pain - We didn't miss the breading at all.... and who can go wrong with bacon!!!! FABULOUS!!!!
158086,105670,2006-10-16,5,made these for euchre...they were a big hit....but boy are the a pistol to clean...the fumes were really getting to me...I had the front door open so I could get some fresh air and it was 30 degrees out...haha
17803,105670,2008-11-01,5,"Yum! I left the stem on, so we could have a handle to hold onto while we ate them.  My favorite tool, a grapefruit spoon, was used to remove the seeds and membrane.  I found that if you angel the center of the bacon over the center top of the pepper that the ends can easily be tucked under the pepper and put on the baking sheet. Don't be afraid to stretch that bacon around the pepper.  These were not spicy hot at all.  I was surprised, even though I know the heat came from the seeds and membrane.   DH knowing these were  jalapenos, ate 2 of them after I had told him they were not hot.  He does not do spicy foods at all!   I'll be making these again, thank you so much for posting this recipe.  Made for *Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup 2008* game"
140132,105670,2008-12-18,5,I made these for the game and we all loved  them.  Even my daughter who doesnt' like HEAT loved these.  Thank you for the recipe to one of our favorite appies.
383346,105670,2012-02-29,5,Yummy!  Simple but so good.  The only thing I didn't like was the bacon to sizzle in the oven.  But the taste is amazing.  Thanks AZRoxy :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
369715,105670,2012-03-01,4,"My husband made these. As written he thought they were a bit bland but to the next batch he added some spices to the cheese mixture. He used season salt, garlic powder and pepper. They enjoyed them."
107135,105670,2012-10-08,5,my son james loves these  he cooks them on the grill
305531,105670,2014-04-26,5,Yum! These are so good. My grandson loves to make these for us to snack on. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for Name That Ingredient Tag.
133174,95569,2004-10-14,5,Awesome!  This was super easy and delicious.  I used my Memphis Barbecue Sauce (#98940) and added a touch of liquid smoke.  Shredded the chicken with two forks.  Served on lightly toasted whole wheat buns with Seasame Slaw (#41689). Thanks Kree for a wonderful easy meal.
104295,95569,2004-10-18,5,"I have made barbeque like this for a long time, but always with ribs bought on sale.  This is a much healthier alternative.  We enjoyed it tonight for dinner with broccoli & cauliflower, baked beans, and french fries.  Yum!"
173579,95569,2006-04-12,5,We liked this a lot. I used Bullseye Barbeque Sauce. Can't get much easier than this.  Thanks for posting. 
8688,95569,2007-08-21,5,"Nothing could be easier than this!  I used Kree's recommended barbecue sauce for a great pulled barbecue sandwich!  I served with Recipe #196430 and Recipe #229171 for a great weeknight meal.  Thanks so much, Kree!"
95743,95569,2008-01-15,0,"I must be the only one in the world who thinks chicken breasts can be overcooked, particularly in a crockpot.  Sorry, Kree."
140132,95569,2009-01-05,4,We had this and was a hit.  I had chicken and was looking for something different.  I tried this and the family gave it a big thumbs up.  thank you for a recipe for chicken that is something new forus.
101823,95569,2009-06-20,5,"Following newspapergal's lead, I doctored up some cheap BBQ sauce that was hanging out in the pantry and was amazed at how good this was. We layered the shredded chicken on toasted whole wheat buns and topped with mounds of creamy coleslaw. Yum. So easy and so good."
39835,95569,2009-12-27,5,"This was delicious -- threw the chicken, onion and 1/2 bottle of barbecue cause in the crockpot - went out for the day - sandwiches and salad -- dinner is done -- with virtually no work -- and delicious too! Thanks for sharing!"
400708,95569,2011-02-19,4,"Well, here's rating #281, and no wonder - this recipe has it all.  Ease of preparation, great flavor (depends on your barbecue sauce, so use a good one that you like) and enjoyed by the whole family.  I made my own hamburger buns from my recipe#445540 and it went very well.  I used a bottled sauce that I tweaked to our liking, cooked the onions with the chicken in the crock pot, and served with jalapeno slices and cheese.  Don't do what I did, thinking it didn't have enough water I added a 1/4 cup to the pot when I started and it watered it down WAY to much as it cooked, had to drain it off and add more sauce.  The recipe is right on as to how to fix this very comforting, fast dish.  Made for Comfort Foods in the photo forum."
174096,95569,2012-02-04,5,"Yum!  This is most certainly easy and tastes great.  I used about 3 lbs of chicken with the full 18 oz of sauce, which worked out great.  The meat was tender and flavorful and made great sandwiches.  I have plenty of leftovers, which we look forward to enjoying.  Thanks for sharing!  L-O-V-E '12 Event."
369715,95569,2012-02-23,4,This was so easy to make and tasted good. My chicken was a bit dry but tasty. I used about 1.5 pounds of chicken and used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce. We thought it could have used more bbq sauce too. Everyone enjoyed this.
482376,95569,2012-12-22,5,You can't get much easier than this! I had all the ingredients at home and threw everything together in a few minutes. We had a yummy bbq aroma all day and the end result was so tasty. This is a keeper for a quick dinner that will please. Thank you!
1179225,95569,2013-02-26,5,Such a simple recipe to have on hand when you want a tasty dinner to come home to without a lot of assembly time. I used bone-in skinless thighs and  served with coleslaw and we really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to trying it with skinless breasts. Thanks for posting the recipe.
101823,32844,2003-10-24,5,"This recipe is similar (alright, almost identical) to one I posted.  (BowTies w/ Sausage, Tomato and Cream)  I had searched the Zaar site for my Bow Tie recipe before posting, but hadn't thought to look for 'Pasta' in the title.  Anyway, this is a favorite of my husband's.  It is quick, easy and has an awesome flavor.  I think that the kielbasa in my recipe adds somthing, but there are many types of sausage to play with.  I recommend choosing your favorite."
8688,32844,2005-03-07,5,"I can't believe I didn't try this sooner! This recipe is so delicious and couldn't be easier to prepare. I made exactly as directed for a scrumptious supper for two. Don't make the same mistake I did, Folks! Do not delay and go ahead and have this for supper tonight!  You will be glad you did ; ) Thanks for sharing this one with us, Ginny!"
95743,32844,2005-03-08,5,Wonderful.  I lightened it a bit with half-and-half rather than cream and spiced it up with hot sausage and both worked just fine.  Looking forward to making this with fresh tomatoes this summer.
53932,32844,2005-04-30,5,Great recipe!  I didn't change a thing and it was just superb.
222564,32844,2005-10-29,4,"Real man food, got 10 stars from hubby! Ok, I liked it, too. 4 1/2 stars."
158086,32844,2006-11-07,4,"This was very good, I used half and half so it was not that rich.."
140132,32844,2008-06-12,5,"We couldn't get enough of this.  I will repeat this dish often as we all loved it and almost licked the pan clean....lol. I did add a touch more whipping cream but other then that followed recipe.  I served this with a green salad and garlic bread. Thank you for posting, delicious."
1072593,32844,2010-01-17,5,Words fail me so I'll just scream----LOOOOOOOOOVED IT!  Made for Alphabet Soup Tag.
136997,32844,2014-07-21,5,"Very quick and easy weeknight meal. I used bow tie pasta and subbed in fresh basil, from my garden, for the parsley. :)"
95743,70165,2003-10-10,5,"At our house, the best pizza crust is a thin, crisp-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside crust.  This fits the bill.  It was just the right amount of dough to make two 12"" crusts, the size of my baking stone. If you wanted to make slightly bigger crusts, I'm sure that would work as well.   It rolled and stretched easily and the 20 minute bake time was right on."
222564,70165,2007-01-15,4,Great pizza bottom! I did use 1 cup whole meal flour and pre baked the bottom 10 minutes. It turned out really well. Thin and crusty.
158086,70165,2008-10-27,5,Wow this recipe was a life saver.  I had a boboli crust I was going to use but it had expireed 12 days ago...so I made this one instead...turned out great....now I wonder why I bother buying the boboli?  This was so simple..
140132,70165,2009-03-24,4,Oh yummy.  I love thin crust pizza and this is a good recipe for it.  We made two pizzas and both turned out good.  I had no idea it was so easy to put a homemade crust together.  Thank you for introducing me to a new favorite.
126440,70165,2009-05-19,5,"I have used this many, many times, I can't believe I haven't done a review.   This is just what we love.  Easy to do and makes two so you can use later in the week or freeze."
1072593,70165,2009-11-11,5,"Silly me, after about five minutes into eating this I had the incredibly strong urge to speak Neapolitan.  Can you guess why?  Made for Alphabet Soup."
101823,70165,2010-04-13,5,"I have had very poor experiences with yeast, and was quite gun-shy of homemade pizza crust. This recipe worked well even for a flop like me. Even my discriminating husband approves."
1179225,70165,2011-07-05,5,Great crust! I replaced about a 1/4 of the flour with whole wheat and would do that again next time. The crust held up really well. Thanks so much for posting!
176615,70165,2012-07-17,5,"Worked well! Doubled the recipe, made two pizzas (one was recipe #70951) and froze two balls of dough for later. Next time I'll remember to prebake the crust when using a 12 inch pizza pan. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
498271,70165,2013-11-04,5,"This dough made a great thin-crust pizza!  I did prebake the crust for a little less than 10 minutes and brushed the top with a little olive oil first.  Thin and crispy, this made a fantastic pizza - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1072593,64446,2015-09-08,5,"263 reviews!!  You review hogger, you!  Well deserved."
39835,64446,2006-01-08,5,Wonderful bread! Perfect with Rosemary and Lemon Pork Stew recipe#116382. Will definitely be making this easy bread again soon! Thanks for sharing!
140132,64446,2008-08-04,5,This was fantastic.  I took advantage of our fresh herbs in the garden and this bread turned out so good.  We dipped it into olive oil dipping sauce and my whole family devoured it in minutes....yes I said minutes....lol.  Thank you for posting this delicious bread.
1179225,64446,2009-10-24,5,"This bread is delicious. I used Penzy's pasta sprinkle instead of rosemary. I topped it with egg & sea salt. It was easy, flavorful, and beautiful to look at. Thanks for posting this great recipe. I'll be using it often."
400708,64446,2014-09-02,5,"I made the dough in the bread machine and then shaped, allowed a 2nd rise and baked in the oven.  Sprinkled the top with the extra Rosemary and sea salt and it turned out great.  I love the flavor of the Rosemary and  the salt gave it an extra flavor that we enjoyed.  Next time though I think I&#039;ll use the egg wash instead of the extra butter as I like the shine I get from that.  As an update:  Continue to use this awesome recipe, my family likes it served with a dipping sauce of olive oil and balsamic vinegar with Italian herbs.  Never a piece left over"
173579,90674,2006-12-01,5,This was fantastic.  The best french toast we have ever had.  I used regular bread and it was still great.  Thanks for posting such a fabulous recipe.
8688,90674,2007-11-15,5,"This is a great recipe for French Toast!  I cut extra wide slices of recipe #71373 to use in place of the Texas Toast and topped the finished product with recipe #265593 and real Canadian Maple Syrup!  The flavor was outstanding! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Earnhardt!"
226863,90674,2009-04-12,5,"Very good french toast recipe!  Like other reviewers stated, be careful not to let your griddle or skillet get to hot.  With the sugar in the coating, they are quick to burn.  This was a very enjoyable weekend breakfast.  Thanks for posting!  Made for Chef Alphabet Soup Tag."
140132,90674,2010-01-13,5,"I made this for my family last night for dinner.  We really liked it and will repeat this recipe often.  I loved the texas toast in these, perfect.  Thank you for posting."
222564,90674,2010-06-23,5,"As good as fresh donuts, less hassle. We have made these for countless times by now."
126440,90674,2011-11-27,5,Excellent French toast.<br/>I used Recipe #408880 for the bread and Oh My! <br/>Wonderful.  DH kept saying how good it was and<br/>loved the flavor with the cranberry.
176615,90674,2012-07-03,5,"Great! For no lumps, mix dry ingredients, add milk and vanilla and mix until smooth. Mix in eggs last. The kids gobbled this up. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
95743,87075,2004-04-03,5,"Loved this sandwich!  I'm from the midwest but have never had this sandwich and boy have I missed out.  Dh went absolutely nuts for it.  Really, really good and so quick and easy.  After browning the ground beef I let it drain for quite a while so the end result was not the least bit greasy.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It's perfect."
133174,87075,2004-05-21,5,"These were wonderful.  DH and I really enjoyed them.  I didn't put in the amount of salt called for because I think they would have been salty.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and will do so again.  Thanks for posting."
176615,87075,2004-12-23,5,"My family really enjoyed these simple, quick sandwiches, even the ultra picky 3 year-old, and my husband wants to make sure I keep the recipe handy so we can have them again soon. I made mine with lots of mustard and pickles as suggested and they were very tasty. Really good as is but I'll cut the salt to a teaspoon next time. Thanks, plantfreek, for posting the wonderful recipe as well as the story behind it!"
140132,87075,2007-02-08,5,"I have never had loosemeat before, but am sure glad we tried these.  My family wasn't sure they would like them since they are used to their usual ""sloppy joe"".  I told them to give these a try, and lo and behold they liked these better!
I doubled the recipe and we had none leftover.  I served them as suggested and don't think I will ever change that.....Stephanie"
128473,87075,2007-08-09,5,"This is really nice comfort food. We really enjoyed this sandwich. It was the first time we ever tried loosemeat but it won't be the last. Very tasty, the dill pickle and mustard mix really well together, it gives the sandwich that extra little something. Thanks for sharing Plantfreek"
158086,87075,2009-02-02,5,I tripled this recipe for our superbowl dinner party and they were a big big hit....We served exactly as the recipe said....
542159,87075,2012-05-13,4,"A delightful sandwich that received mixed reviews. Those who grew up eating Sloppy Joe's loved this and said it was outstanding. Then there were those whom grew up eating something similar to this but without the sugar and with the addition of Worcestershire sauce who enjoyed but not as much as the Sloppy Joe eaters. I did make this as written right down to using a cast iron pan and traditional yellow mustard with some really good dill pickle slices. This was received well enough that I will be making it again, thanks for the post."
140132,131018,2008-06-04,4,This was good.  I liked the flavor from the ginger ale on the pork.  The meat was very tender and moist.  Thank you for posting....Stephanie
173579,131018,2008-12-30,5,I made this for a get together last night at my house.  Everybody just raved about it.  I will be using this from now on.  Great potluck meal!  Thanks for sharing.
498271,131018,2009-02-18,5,"All I can say is mmmmmm - this is just great stuff!!  I have a large crock pot and cooked my 3.75lb roast for 6 hours on high, then for 2 hours on low after shredding and adding the bbq sauce.  Delicious flavor, so simple to make - wonderful - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for the Best of 2008 event"
88099,131018,2009-05-17,4,"This was very good. I had 3 pounds of pork tenderloin roast that I used. I left the fat strap on, but it still got very dry. I cooked it for 8 hours and then an hour and a half with the barbecue sauce. I used recipe #123417 for the sauce. Will have to adjust the cooking times for my very large crockpot. Thanks for sharing. Made for Zaar Stars."
158086,131018,2010-01-10,5,I used a can of beer instead of ginger ale and I used Brownwood Farms Cherry BBQ Sauce and it was outstanding!....Mine cooked alot faster than stated in the recipe but I have a big Cuisinart Slow cooker and it always cooks way faster then the others...Great recipe!
305531,131018,2010-03-12,5,Yum! This was simple and very tasty. I used a hickory smoke barbecue sauce that was nice. Thanks duonyte for a new keeper. Made for Gimme 5 Tag.
226863,131018,2010-12-15,5,"This is very good, but not quite as good as the one I make with Pepsi....but that could be because that is what I am used to.  I cooked my pork butt on low for 10 hours, then shredded and added the barbecue sauce for 2 hours.  It would have been overcooked and dry if I had cooked it longer.  But I did cook in a newer crockpot.....I think if I'd made it in a cylinder shaped older crockpot, I'd need to cook it longer.  But I also think the older models cook more evenly and would have kept it more moist.  I love to do this when I can't smoke my pork butt on the grill, and it is wonderful to take to sell at little league concession stands and high school concession stands...stays hot and you can sell a lot of sandwiches!!  Thanks for posting this."
424680,131018,2011-03-29,5,"Made this recipe as given, using one of the BBQ sauces I'd made during this Spring's PAC event, & the cooking times for me were considerably different! After 6 1/2 hours on low, I added the sauce & cooked it another hour or so, but that was about it, & it was absolutely wonderful! After a meal for the 2 of us, I kept enough out for one more meal, then portioned the remaining BBQed pork into 2-serving packets & froze 'em! The only way to go, in my opinion! Thanks for sharing this great recipe! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Stars Tag]"
133174,131018,2013-01-28,5,"This is on my menu for game day!  I made this the other day and everyone really loved it.  Changes?  I used a lean pork roast, 1/2 a bottle of sauce and cooked it on low for about 5 to 6 hours.  After the pork was pulled the additional 1/2 bottle sauce and about 1 cup of the cooking liquid was poured over the meat and finished the cooking process.  So simple and so utterly yummy."
39835,131018,2013-06-22,5,We loved this - used diet ginger ale but other wise followed the recipe as written -- only cooked for 8 hours before shredding on adding bq sauce and cooked for another 4 1/2 hours or so. My butt roast was 4 1/2 pounds which was on sale and this was the perfect way to use it! Thanks for sharing!
400708,131018,2014-07-15,5,I&#039;ll just add my 5 stars to this easy recipe.  Needed something to go with my homemade pretzel rolls and this sounded so easy it was perfect.  Followed the directions and even my picky grandkids loved it after tasting and didn&#039;t leave a bit on the plate.
140132,43072,2008-06-25,4,"These were really good.  I had some cottage cheese to use up and I found this recipe.  I'm so glad I did, it was a great breakfast.  I will make this again, it was easy and tasty.  Thank you for posting."
1179225,43072,2010-01-15,5,These were a nice change from the usual pancakes we make. Nice texture and I wasn't hungry the rest of the day. Thanks for posting.
